Now listen to a conversation between two students.

(man) Hey, Mary, how's your volunteer work going? You're still involved in`参与` that after-school program with the elementary kids?
> Mary，你的志愿者工作做的怎样了？你仍还要参与课后的基础小朋友节目。

(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow.
> 是的，但是我有一个问题。明天我要载着一群孩子去动物园。

(man) Yeah?
> 是吗？

(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental`租赁` agency to reserve`预定` one.
> 并且我为了这个行程租了一个小巴。但是我等待太久不能通知租赁公司留一辆。

(man) Oh!
> 哦！

(woman) Now it turns out`原来` they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled.
> 现在，原来他们没有一辆可用的小巴给明天。我不知道做什么？这些孩子肯定会失望的，如果他们的行程取消了的话。

(man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day?
> 嗯好，你校园中的朋友有车吗？我的意思，能否为了明天借一下？

(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids.
> 是的，可能有，但是我需要借两辆，或许没有乘坐所有孩子的足够的空间。

(man) Um, hum.
> 恩。

(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself.
> 这就是为什么租小巴。并且我需要找其他人来驾驶。我无法自己开两辆车。

(man) Yeah, that’s true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself ==the trouble of hunting down`捉住` a second driver==, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there’s a bus line that goes right past the zoo.
> 是，是这样的。我觉得你也许能找到一个志愿者，或者你想节省你自己找到第二个司机的麻烦的话，公共交通怎么样？看一下巴士的时间表，我认为有路过动物园的巴士路线。

(woman) Yeah, that’s a possibility, but I don’t know, it might be a real challenge supervising`监督` the kids on the bus.
> 是的，这是一种可能性，但是我不知道，在巴士上看住孩子也许是一个实际的挑战。

(man) Ha, ha…
> 哈哈……

(woman) Sometimes they are a handful`难管教的人[尤指孩子]` when they get excited. It’s an option, though`不过`.
> 有时当他们兴奋的时候很难管。不过，这是一种选择。

### Task 6

<audio id="audio" controls="controls" preload="none" loop="loop">
    <source id="mp3" src="../../audio/tpo1_speaking_question6_dialog.mp3">
</audio>

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. The professor is discussing the mathematical capabilities of babies.

(female professor)Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual abilities of babies. They say there's evidence that babies as young as five months old can do basic arithmetic, that they can add. Scientists think babies know one plus one equals two and not one. The evidence is indirect because obviously you can't ask a five-month old baby to add up some numbers for you.So they devised an experiment where, um, in this experiment a baby is shown a doll on a table. Ok, so the baby looks at the doll. Then the researcher lowers a screen in front of the doll, so now the doll is hidden behind the screen. But the baby has already seen the doll and, so, knows it's there.Well, then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the screen with the first one. Ok, so now you have two dolls behind the scree , right? Well, no, cause what the researcher did was they secretly took away one of the dolls. And then when they raised the screen back up, the baby, well, it expects to see two dolls, right? But there’s only one there! And guess what? The baby surprised! It expects two but it only sees one. How could the researchers tell that the baby surprised? Well, they recorded the baby’s eye movement on camera. And we know that when a baby is surprised by something, a loud noise or an unexpected flash of light maybe, it stares at where the noise or light is coming from. And that’s what the babies in the experiment did. They stared, cause the babies know if you add one doll and one doll, you should have two dolls. So when it sees one doll, then it stares because it’s surprised.

    Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. 
    > 现在听心理学课的部分演讲。
    
    The professor is discussing the mathematical capabilities of babies.
    > 这个教授正在讨论婴儿的数学能力。

    (female professor)Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual`高智力的` abilities of babies.
    > （女性教授）科学家学到很多有趣的关于婴儿智力能力的事儿。

    They say there's evidence that babies as young as`一样年轻` five months old can do basic arithmetic, that they can add.
    > 他们说有证据，婴儿五个月大时能够做基本的他们能加法的算数的证据。

    Scientists think babies know one plus one equals two and not one.
    > 科学家认为婴儿知道一加一等于二，并且不是一。

    The evidence is indirect because obviously you can't ask a five-month old baby to add up some numbers for you.
    > 这个证据是间接的，因为你不能明显地问一个五个月大的孩子加一些数字给你。

    So they devised`设计，想出` an experiment where, um, in this experiment a baby is shown a doll on a table.
    > 所以他们想出一个实验，在实验中，一个婴儿被展示一个娃娃在桌子上。

    Ok, so the baby looks at the doll.
    > 好，这时，这个婴儿看着这个娃娃。

    Then the researcher lowers a screen in front of the doll, so now the doll is hidden behind the screen.
    > 然后研究院在娃娃的前面降下一个屏幕，那么现在这个娃娃被隐藏在屏幕后面。

    <font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> the baby has already seen the doll and, so, knows it's there.
    > 但是婴儿已经看到娃娃了，并知道它就在那儿。

    Well, then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the screen with <font color='hotpink'>**the first 最高级**</font> one.
    > 好，然后这个研究院拿起第二个娃娃，并且非常明显地把它放在有第一个娃娃的屏幕后面。

    Ok, so now you have two dolls behind the screen, right? 
    > 好，那么现在你有2个娃娃在屏幕后，对吧？
    
    Well, no, cause what the researcher did was they secretly took away one of the dolls.
    > 恩，不，因为研究员做什么是他们秘密的拿走娃娃中的一个。

    And then when they raised the screen back up, the baby, well, it expects to see two dolls, right? 
    > 然后当他们升起屏幕恢复的时候，这个婴儿，好，它期望看到2个娃娃，对吧？

    <font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> there’s <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> one there! 
    > 但是只有一个在那里！
    
    And guess what? The baby surprised! 
    > 同时猜测什么？这个婴儿被惊到！
    
    It expects two but it <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> sees one.
    > 它期待2个却只看到1个。
    
    How could the researchers tell that the baby surprised? 
    > 研究员如何能够说，婴儿被惊到？

    Well, they recorded the baby’s eye movement on camera.
    > 好，他们用相机记录了婴儿眼睛的运动。
    
    And we know that when a baby is surprised by something, a loud noise or an unexpected flash of light maybe, it stares at where the noise or light is coming from.
    > 并且我们知道，当婴儿被什么事儿惊到时，也许是一个大声的噪音或未知的光闪，它盯着那儿，声音和光来的地方。

    And that’s what the babies in the experiment did.
    > 那就是婴儿在实验中做了什么。

    They stared`担任主演`, cause the babies know if you add one doll and one doll, you should have two dolls.
    > 他们担任主要角色，因为婴儿知道，如果你加一个娃娃再加一个娃娃，你应该有两个娃娃。

    So when it sees one doll, then it stares because it’s surprised.
    > 那么当它看到一个娃娃，然后它盯着看，因为它被惊到了。
