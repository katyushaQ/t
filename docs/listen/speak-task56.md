Now listen to a conversation between two students.

(man) Hey, Mary, how's your volunteer work going? You're still involved in that after-school program with the elementary kids?

(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow.

(man) Yeah?

(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental agency to reserve one.

(man) Oh!

(woman) Now it turns out they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled.

(man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day?

(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids.

(man) Um, hum.

(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself.

(man) Yeah, that’s true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself the trouble of hunting down a second driver, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there’s a bus line that goes right past the zoo.

(woman) Yeah, that’s a possibility, but I don’t know, it might be a real challenge supervising the kids on the bus.

(man) Ha, ha…

(woman) Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited. It’s an option, though.

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. The professor is discussing the mathematical capabilities of babies.

(female professor)Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual abilities of babies. They say there's evidence that babies as young as five months old can do basic arithmetic, that they can add. Scientists think babies know one plus one equals two and not one. The evidence is indirect because obviously you can't ask a five-month old baby to add up some numbers for you.So they devised an experiment where, um, in this experiment a baby is shown a doll on a table. Ok, so the baby looks at the doll. Then the researcher lowers a screen in front of the doll, so now the doll is hidden behind the screen. But the baby has already seen the doll and, so, knows it's there.Well, then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the screen with the first one. Ok, so now you have two dolls behind the scree , right? Well, no, cause what the researcher did was they secretly took away one of the dolls. And then when they raised the screen back up, the baby, well, it expects to see two dolls, right? But there’s only one there! And guess what? The baby surprised! It expects two but it only sees one. How could the researchers tell that the baby surprised? Well, they recorded the baby’s eye movement on camera. And we know that when a baby is surprised by something, a loud noise or an unexpected flash of light maybe, it stares at where the noise or light is coming from. And that’s what the babies in the experiment did. They stared, cause the babies know if you add one doll and one doll, you should have two dolls. So when it sees one doll, then it stares because it’s surprised.
