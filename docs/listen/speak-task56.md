In advertising various strategies are used to persuade people to buy products. ==In order to== {++sell more products++}, advertisers ==will== often {++try to make us believe++} that a product ==will== {++meet our needs or desires++} perfectly, even if it's not true. The strategies that they use ==can== {++be subtle++}, friendly {++forms of persuasion++} that are sometimes hard to recognize.In a lot of ads, {++repetition is a key strategy++}. Research ==shows== that {++repeated exposure to a message, even something meaningless or untrue, is enough to make people accept it or see it in a positive light++}. You've all seen the car commercials on TV like, uh, the one that refers to its roomy cars over and over again. You know which one I mean. This guy is driving around and keeps stopping to pick up different people. He picks up three or four people. And each time, ==the narrator says==, {++“Plenty of room for friends, plenty of room for family, plenty of room for everybody.”++} {++The same message is repeated several times++} in the course of the commercial. Now the car, the car ==actually== {++looks kind of small, it’s not a big car at all++}, ==but== {++you get the sense that it’s pretty spacious++}. You’d ==think== {++the viewer would reach the logical conclusion that the slogan miss-represents the product++}, ==instead==, {++what usually happens is that when the statement ""plenty of room"" is repeated often enough++}, {++people are actually convinced it’s true++}. Um, ==another strategy== they use is to {++get a celebrity to advertise a product++}. It ==turns out== that {++we’re more likely to accept an advertisement claim made by somebody famous, a person we admire and find appealing++}. We ==tend to== {++think they’re trustworthy++}. ==So==, uh, {++you might have a car commercial that features a well-known race car driver++}. Now, {++it may not be a very fast car, uh, it could even be an inexpensive vehicle with a low performance rating.++} ==But== {++if a popular race car driver is shown driving it and saying, “I like my cars fast!” Then people would believe the car is impressive with its speed."++}

    In advertising various strategies are used to persuade people to`说服某人做某事` buy products.
    > 广告不同的方案中，用于说服人们购买产品。

    In order to sell <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> products, advertisers will often try to make us believe that a product will meet our needs`满足需求` or desires perfectly, even if it's not true.
    > 为了卖掉更多的产品，广告人常常会尝试使我们相信，一个产品会完美地满足我们的需求或渴望，即使它不是真的。

    The strategies that they use can be subtle`巧妙的，精细的`, friendly forms of persuasion`说服` that are sometimes hard to recognize.
    > 他们使用的方案能是巧妙的，有时很难去意识到的友好地说服形式。

    In a lot of ads, repetition`重复` is a key strategy.
    > 在大量的广告中，重复是关键策略。

    Research shows that repeated exposure`曝光，报道` to a message, even something meaningless or untrue, is enough to make people accept it or see it in a positive light`正面的角度`.
    > 研究显示，重复的报道一个信息，甚至无意义的和不真实的事，是足够使人接受它，或在正面的角度看到它。

    You've all seen the car commercials`商业广告` on TV like, uh, the one that refers to`提到` its roomy`宽敞的` cars over and over again.
    > 你看过的所有汽车商业广告，在电视上，像，厄，一个提到它的宽敞的汽车，一遍又一遍。

    You know which one I mean.
    > 你知道我的意思是哪一个（广告）。

    This guy is driving around`到处` and keeps stopping`继续做某事` to pick up different people.
    > 这个人正在到处驾驶，然后继续开，并停下来去接不同的人。

    He picks up three or four people.
    > 他接了3或4个人。

    And each time, the narrator`解说员` says, “Plenty of room for friends, plenty of room for family, plenty of room for everybody” .
    > 并且每当这个时候，解说员说“大量空间对朋友，对家人，对每一个人”。

    The same message is repeated several times in the course of`过程` the commercial.
    > 同样的信息被重复了很多次，在商业广告的过程中。

    Now the car, the car actually looks kind of`有点，有几分` small, it’s not a big car at all`完全不，一点都不`, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> you get the sense that it’s pretty spacious`宽敞的`.
    > 现在这个汽车，汽车实际上看着有点小，它一点都不是一个大车，但是你有一个它是相当宽敞的感觉。

    You’d think the viewer`电视观众` would reach`达成` the logical conclusion that the slogan`广告语` miss-represents the product, instead, what usually happens is that when the statement ""plenty of room"" is repeated often enough, people are actually convinced it’s true.
    > 你会想，观众会达成逻辑结论，没有代表的产品，替代，什么是通常发生的，当说到“大量空间被重复常常足够，人们实际上被说服它是真的。

    Um, another strategy they use is to get a celebrity to advertise a product.
    > 恩，他们使用的另一个方案是找一个明星代言产品。

    It turns out`最终的结果是` that we’re <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> likely to accept an advertisement claim`声称` made by somebody famous, a person we admire`欣赏，喜欢` and find appealing`吸引人的`.
    > 最终的结果是，我们更可能接受一个由某些著名的人做的广告声明，一个我们欣赏的吸引人的人。

    We tend to think they’re trustworthy`值得信赖的`.
    > 我们会认为他们是值得信赖的。

    So, uh, you might have a car commercial that features`以……为特征` a well-known race car driver.
    > 所以，厄，你也许有一个商业广告，以众所周知的跑车车手为特征。

    Now, it may not be a very fast car, uh, it could even be an inexpensive vehicle with a low performance rating.
    > 现在，它也许不是一个非常快的车，厄，它甚至会是一个不贵的低性能的车车。

    <font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> if a popular race car driver is shown driving it and saying, “I like my cars fast!” Then people would believe the car is impressive`给人印象深刻的` with its
     speed.".

Now listen to a part of a talk in an economics class.

Professor:

So, let’s talk about money. What is money? ==Well==, {++typically people think of coins and paper “bills” as money...++} ==but== {++that’s using a somewhat narrow definition of the term++}. ==A broad definition is this==: [slowly] {++money is anything that people can use to make purchases with++}. ==Since== {++many things can be used to make purchases, money can have many different forms++}. ==Certainly==, {++coins and bills are one form of money++}. People exchange goods and services for coins or paper bills, and they use this money... these bills...to obtain other goods and services. For example, you might give a taxi driver five dollars to purchase a ride in his taxi. **And** he in turn gives the five dollars to a farmer to buy some vegetables. ==But==, as I said, {++coins and bills aren’t the only form of money under this broad definition++}. Some societies make use of a barter system. ==Basically==, {++in a barter system people exchange goods and services directly for other goods and services++}. The taxi driver, for example, might give a ride to a farmer in exchange for some vegetables. ==Since== {++the vegetables are used to pay for a service, by our broad definition the vegetables are used in barter as a form of money++}. Now, as I mentioned, ==there’s also a second==... {++a narrower definition of money++}. In the United States only coins and bills are legal tender - meaning that by law, a seller ==must== {++accept them as payment++}. The taxi driver must accept coins or bills as payment for a taxi ride. OK? ==But== {++in the U.S., the taxi driver is not required to accept vegetables in exchange for a ride++}. ==So== {++a narrower definition of money might be whatever is legal tender in a society, whatever has to be accepted as payment++}.

    What is money? ==Well==, {++typically people think of coins and paper “bills” as money++}.

    ==but== that’s using a somewhat narrow definition of the term.

    ==A broad`广泛的` definition is this==: [slowly] {++money is anything that people can use to make purchases with++}.

(Man)Mary, I’m so glad I ran into`偶尔遇见` you.
> Mary，很高兴偶然遇见你。

(Woman)Oh hello, Professor Jensen.
> 哦你好，Jensen 教授。

(Man)Listen, I know it’s short notice`在短时间内，仓促`...and ==maybe== {++you’ve already made plans for spring break`春游`++}... ==but==...{++one of my students just dropped out`退出` of the field trip`实地考察旅行` to the Smithson River Caves`溶洞`.You’re next on the waiting list`替补名单`, so now there’s room for you to come along`出现，来到`.++}
> 听着，我知道这很仓促……并且也许你已经为春游做了计划……但是……我的一个学生刚刚退出去Smithson河溶洞的实地考察旅行。你是替补名单上的下一个，那么现在对你的到来是有房间的。

(Woman)You’re kidding! [disappointed] I ==didn’t think== {++there was a chance++}… and...==well==, {++it’s a three-day trip, right?++} ==I agreed to== {++spend next week helping Professor Clark set up`建立，安排` the new museum exhibition.++} ==I think== {++she’s really counting on`指望` me.++}

### Task 5

Now listen to a conversation between two students.

(man) Hey, Mary, how's your volunteer work going? You're still involved in`参与` that after-school program with the elementary kids?
> Mary，你的志愿者工作做的怎样了？你仍还要参与课后的基础小朋友节目。

(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow.
> 是的，但是我有一个问题。明天我要载着一群孩子去动物园。

(man) Yeah?
> 是吗？

(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental`租赁` agency to reserve`预定` one.
> 并且我为了这个行程租了一个小巴。但是我等待太久不能通知租赁公司留一辆。

(man) Oh!
> 哦！

(woman) Now it turns out`原来` they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled.
> 现在，原来他们没有一辆可用的小巴给明天。我不知道做什么？这些孩子肯定会失望的，如果他们的行程取消了的话。

(man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day?
> 嗯好，你校园中的朋友有车吗？我的意思，能否为了明天借一下？

(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids.
> 是的，可能有，但是我需要借两辆，或许没有乘坐所有孩子的足够的空间。

(man) Um, hum.
> 恩。

(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself.
> 这就是为什么租小巴。并且我需要找其他人来驾驶。我无法自己开两辆车。

(man) Yeah, that’s true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself ==the trouble of hunting down`捉住` a second driver==, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there’s a bus line that goes right past the zoo.
> 是，是这样的。我觉得你也许能找到一个志愿者，或者你想节省你自己找到第二个司机的麻烦的话，公共交通怎么样？看一下巴士的时间表，我认为有路过动物园的巴士路线。

(woman) Yeah, that’s a possibility, but I don’t know, it might be a real challenge supervising`监督` the kids on the bus.
> 是的，这是一种可能性，但是我不知道，在巴士上看住孩子也许是一个实际的挑战。

(man) Ha, ha…
> 哈哈……

(woman) Sometimes they are a handful`难管教的人[尤指孩子]` when they get excited. It’s an option, though`不过`.
> 有时当他们兴奋的时候很难管。不过，这是一种选择。

### Task 6

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. The professor is discussing the mathematical capabilities of babies.

(female professor)Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual abilities of babies. They say there's evidence that babies as young as five months old can do basic arithmetic, that they can add. Scientists think babies know one plus one equals two and not one. The evidence is indirect because obviously you can't ask a five-month old baby to add up some numbers for you.So they devised an experiment where, um, in this experiment a baby is shown a doll on a table. Ok, so the baby looks at the doll. Then the researcher lowers a screen in front of the doll, so now the doll is hidden behind the screen. But the baby has already seen the doll and, so, knows it's there.Well, then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the screen with the first one. Ok, so now you have two dolls behind the scree , right? Well, no, cause what the researcher did was they secretly took away one of the dolls. And then when they raised the screen back up, the baby, well, it expects to see two dolls, right? But there’s only one there! And guess what? The baby surprised! It expects two but it only sees one. How could the researchers tell that the baby surprised? Well, they recorded the baby’s eye movement on camera. And we know that when a baby is surprised by something, a loud noise or an unexpected flash of light maybe, it stares at where the noise or light is coming from. And that’s what the babies in the experiment did. They stared, cause the babies know if you add one doll and one doll, you should have two dolls. So when it sees one doll, then it stares because it’s surprised.

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. 
> 现在听心理学课的部分演讲。

The professor is discussing the mathematical capabilities of babies.
> 这个教授正在讨论婴儿的数学能力。

(female professor)Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual`高智力的` abilities of babies.
> （女性教授）科学家学到很多有趣的关于婴儿智力能力的事儿。

They say there's evidence that babies as young as`一样年轻` five months old can do basic arithmetic, that they can add.
> 他们说有证据，婴儿五个月大时能够做基本的他们能加法的算数的证据。

Scientists think babies know one plus one equals two and not one.
> 科学家认为婴儿知道一加一等于二，并且不是一。

The evidence is indirect because obviously you can't ask a five-month old baby to add up some numbers for you.
> 这个证据是间接的，因为你不能明显地问一个五个月大的孩子加一些数字给你。

So they devised`设计，想出` an experiment where, um, in this experiment a baby is shown a doll on a table.
> 所以他们想出一个实验，在实验中，一个婴儿被展示一个娃娃在桌子上。

Ok, so the baby looks at the doll.
> 好，这时，这个婴儿看着这个娃娃。

Then the researcher lowers a screen in front of the doll, so now the doll is hidden behind the screen.
> 然后研究院在娃娃的前面降下一个屏幕，那么现在这个娃娃被隐藏在屏幕后面。

<font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> the baby has already seen the doll and, so, knows it's there.
> 但是婴儿已经看到娃娃了，并知道它就在那儿。

Well, then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the screen with <font color='hotpink'>**the first 最高级**</font> one.
> 好，然后这个研究院拿起第二个娃娃，并且非常明显地把它放在有第一个娃娃的屏幕后面。

Ok, so now you have two dolls behind the screen, right? 
> 好，那么现在你有2个娃娃在屏幕后，对吧？

Well, no, cause what the researcher did was they secretly took away one of the dolls.
> 恩，不，因为研究员做什么是他们秘密的拿走娃娃中的一个。

And then when they raised the screen back up, the baby, well, it expects to see two dolls, right? 
> 然后当他们升起屏幕恢复的时候，这个婴儿，好，它期望看到2个娃娃，对吧？

<font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> there’s <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> one there! 
> 但是只有一个在那里！

And guess what?  
> 同时猜测什么？

The baby surprised!
> 这个婴儿被惊到！

It expects two but it <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> sees one.
> 它期待2个却只看到1个。

How could the researchers tell that the baby surprised? 
> 研究员如何能够说，婴儿被惊到？

Well, they recorded the baby’s eye movement on camera.
> 好，他们用相机记录了婴儿眼睛的运动。

And we know that when a baby is surprised by something, a loud noise or an unexpected flash of light maybe, it stares at where the noise or light is coming from.
> 并且我们知道，当婴儿被什么事儿惊到时，也许是一个大声的噪音或未知的光闪，它盯着那儿，声音和光来的地方。

And that’s what the babies in the experiment did.
> 那就是婴儿在实验中做了什么。

They stared`担任主演`, cause the babies know if you add one doll and one doll, you should have two dolls.
> 他们担任主要角色，因为婴儿知道，如果你加一个娃娃再加一个娃娃，你应该有两个娃娃。

So when it sees one doll, then it stares because it’s surprised.
> 那么当它看到一个娃娃，然后它盯着看，因为它被惊到了。
