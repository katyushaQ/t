Now listen to a conversation between two students.

(man) Hey, Mary, how's your volunteer work going? You're still involved in`参与` that after-school program with the elementary kids?
> Mary，你的志愿者工作做的怎样了？你仍还要参与课后的基础小朋友节目。

(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow.
> 是的，但是我有一个问题。明天我要载着一群孩子去动物园。

(man) Yeah?
> 是吗？

(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental`租赁的` agency to reserve one.
> 并且我为了这个行程租了一个小巴。但是我等待太久不能通知租赁公司留一辆。

(man) Oh!
> 哦！

(woman) Now it turns out`原来` they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled.
> 现在，原来他们没有一辆可用的小巴给明天。我不知道做什么？这些孩子肯定会失望的，如果他们的行程取消了的话。

(man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day?
> 嗯好，你校园中的朋友有车吗？我的意思，能否为了明天借一下？

(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids.
> 是的，可能有，但是我需要借两辆，或许没有乘坐所有孩子的足够的空间。

(man) Um, hum.
> 恩。

(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself.
> 这就是为什么租小巴。并且我需要找其他人来驾驶。我无法自己开两辆车。

(man) Yeah, that’s true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself ==the trouble of hunting down`捉住` a second driver==, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there’s a bus line that goes right past the zoo.
> 是，是这样的。我觉得你也许能找到一个志愿者，或者你想节省你自己找到第二个司机的麻烦的话，公共交通怎么样？看一下巴士的时间表，我认为有路过动物园的巴士路线。

(woman) Yeah, that’s a possibility, but I don’t know, it might be a real challenge supervising`监督` the kids on the bus.
> 是的，这是一种可能性，但是我不知道，在巴士上看住孩子也许是一个实际的挑战。

(man) Ha, ha…
> 哈哈……

(woman) Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited. It’s an option, though`不过`.
> 有时当他们很兴奋的时候很不容易。不过，这是一种选择。

### Task 6

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. The professor is discussing the mathematical capabilities of babies.

(female professor)Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual abilities of babies. They say there's evidence that babies as young as five months old can do basic arithmetic, that they can add. Scientists think babies know one plus one equals two and not one. The evidence is indirect because obviously you can't ask a five-month old baby to add up some numbers for you.So they devised an experiment where, um, in this experiment a baby is shown a doll on a table. Ok, so the baby looks at the doll. Then the researcher lowers a screen in front of the doll, so now the doll is hidden behind the screen. But the baby has already seen the doll and, so, knows it's there.Well, then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the screen with the first one. Ok, so now you have two dolls behind the scree , right? Well, no, cause what the researcher did was they secretly took away one of the dolls. And then when they raised the screen back up, the baby, well, it expects to see two dolls, right? But there’s only one there! And guess what? The baby surprised! It expects two but it only sees one. How could the researchers tell that the baby surprised? Well, they recorded the baby’s eye movement on camera. And we know that when a baby is surprised by something, a loud noise or an unexpected flash of light maybe, it stares at where the noise or light is coming from. And that’s what the babies in the experiment did. They stared, cause the babies know if you add one doll and one doll, you should have two dolls. So when it sees one doll, then it stares because it’s surprised.
