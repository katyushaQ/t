    决定当前气候事件的一个最困难的方面揭露人类活动的影响的证据是, 很难得到所能构成气候的自然变化性的测量. 我们知道, 在过去一千年, 气候经历主要的改变, 没有任何重大人类发明. 我们也知道, 全球气候系统是非常复杂的, 每件事在一些方式中连接, 并且这个系统会在想不到的情况方式下波动. 因此, 我们需要知道, 气候自己主动能变化多少, 为了有把握的解释, 在一定程度上最近的变化是自然的, 与人类活动的结果截然相反.

<font color='Salmon'>Instrumental records</font> <font color='Salmon'>do not</font> go back far enough to <font color='Salmon'>provide us with reliable measurements</font> of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes. To <font color='Salmon'>build up a better picture of fluctuations</font> <font color='hotpink'>**appreciably 程度**</font> further back in time requires us to <font color='Salmon'>use proxy records</font>.

## Part 3 —— 温度变化的范围和共性 —— 顺承Part2
Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica.

To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human activities.

One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate. They can do <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> limited information about natural variability. Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.

##### 1 细节
> Paragraph 1: One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate. We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities.
