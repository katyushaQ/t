## Part 1 —— 如何理解古代埃及艺术
==**In order to understand ancient Egyptian art, it is vital to know as much as <font color='Salmon'>possible of the elite Egyptians' view of the world</font> and <font color='Salmon'>the functions and contexts</font> of the art produced for them.**==

```
段落主旨: 如何理解古代埃及艺术
提问
```

<font color='Salmon'>Without this knowledge</font> we can appreciate <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> <font color='Salmon'>the formal content</font> of Egyptian art, and we will <font color='Salmon'>fail to understand why it was produced or the concepts</font> that shaped it and caused it to adopt its distinctive forms. In fact, <font color='Salmon'>a lack of understanding</font> concerning <font color='Salmon'>the purposes</font> of Egyptian art has often led it to be compared <font color='hotpink'>**unfavorably 程度**</font> with the art of other cultures: Why did the Egyptians not develop sculpture in which the body turned and twisted through space like classical Greek statuary? Why do the artists seem to get left and right confused? And why did they not discover the geometric perspective as European artists did in the Renaissance? 

```
现象: only 理解正式的环境 | 不能理解为什么和概念
原因: 理解缺陷 -> 不利
3 个不理解的原因问题: 为什么不发展雕塑 | 为什么雕塑左右混乱 | 为什么他们没发现几何角度
```

==**The answer to such questions has <font color='Salmon'>nothing to do with a lack of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists</font> and <font color='Salmon'>everything to do with the purposes</font> for which they were producing their art.**== 

```
回答: 与技能和想象力无关 | 与设计意图有关
```

??? quote "translation"
    为了理解古代埃及艺术, 至关重要的是要了解尽可能多的优秀的埃及世界观, 和为了他们而产生的艺术功能和环境. 
    
    在没有这些知识的情况下, 我们只能理解埃及艺术的正式的环境, 我们将无法理解它为什么产生或形成和导致它采用不同形式的概念. 实际上, 一个理解缺陷, 关于埃及艺术的意图的, 常常导致不利, 和其他文化艺术相比: 埃及人为什么不发展雕塑, 身体转动和扭转在空间中的, 就像经典的希腊雕塑? 艺术家做的为什么看上去左后混乱? 还有, 他们为什么没发现几何角度, 像欧洲艺术家在文艺复兴时期所做的. 
    
    这些问题的答案与技能或部分埃及艺术家的想象力无关, 和他们制作他们的艺术意图有关.

### 预判: {--那么他们的设计意图是什么?--} 介绍埃及的一种艺术形式
## Part 2 —— 阐述雕塑功能 - 介绍正面描绘雕塑 [下定义, 怎么来的, 为什么这样, 意义] —— 顺承Part1
==**The majority of three-dimensional representations, whether standing, seated, or kneeling, exhibit what is called <font color='Salmon'>frontality</font>: they <font color='Salmon'>face straight ahead, neither twisting nor turning</font>.**==

```
段落主旨: 定义正面描绘雕塑
```

When such statues are viewed in isolation, out of their original context and <font color='Salmon'>without knowledge of their function</font>, it is easy to <font color='Salmon'>criticize them for their rigid attitudes</font> that remained unchanged for three thousand years. Frontality is, <font color='Blue'>however 句间转折</font>, <font color='hotpink'>**directly 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts</font> in which the statues were set up. Statues were created <font color='Salmon'>not for their decorative effect</font> <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> <font color='Salmon'>to play a primary role</font> in the cults of the gods, the king, and the dead. They were designed to be <font color='Salmon'>put in places</font> where these beings could manifest themselves <font color='Salmon'>in order to be the recipients of ritual actions</font>. Thus it <font color='Salmon'>made sense短语</font> to show the statue <font color='Salmon'>looking ahead at what was happening in front of it</font>, so that <font color='Salmon'>the living performer</font> of the ritual could <font color='Salmon'>interact with the divine or deceased recipient</font>. <font color='hotpink'>**Very often 程度**</font> such statues were enclosed in <font color='Salmon'>rectangular shrines or wall niches</font> whose <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> opening was <font color='Salmon'>at the front</font>, making it <font color='Salmon'>natural for the statue to display frontality</font>. <font color='Salmon'>Other statues</font> were designed to be placed within <font color='Salmon'>an architectural setting</font>, for instance, in front of the monumental <font color='Salmon'>entrance gateways</font> to temples known as <font color='Salmon'>pylons</font>, or <font color='Salmon'>in pillared courts</font>, where they would be placed <font color='Salmon'>against or between pillars</font>: their frontality <font color='Salmon'>worked</font> <font color='hotpink'>**perfectly 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>within the architectural context</font>.

现象: 无知 -> 批判艺术态度
细节: 正面描绘与埃及雕塑的功能和环境有直接的联系
作用: 不为装饰 | 扮演祭祀的重要角色
角色: 仪式行为的接受者 
状态: 看着正前方 -> 活的表演者与它交互
位置: 神庙 | 壁龛 -> 自然展示正面描绘
其他位置: 大门口 -> 塔门 | 靠着柱子 | 在柱子中间
效果: 完美

本段阐述了正面描绘雕塑的怎么来的, 为什么这样, 以及意义
```

??? quote "translation"
    大多数 3D 表现, 不论站着, 坐着, 或跪着, 展示了什么被称为正面描绘: 他们面对正前方, 不扭头也不转头. 
    
    当这些雕塑被孤立地看的时候, 在他们原生的环境之外, 在没有他们的功能知识的情况下, 很容易去批判他们僵硬的态度, 持续 3000 千年保持不变的. 正面描绘是, 然而, 有直接的联系与埃及雕塑的功能和环境, 在这个环境中雕塑被建立. 雕塑不是为了他们的装饰作用而创造, 但是扮演一个主要的角色在神, 国王和死亡的祭祀中. 他们被设计放在一个地方, 这些存在能够表明他们自身为了成为仪式行为的接受者的地方. 因此它对展示看着正前方的雕塑有意义, 在它的前方发生了什么的地方, 仪式活着的表演者能够与神或死者接受者交互. 这些雕塑经常放在长方形的神庙中, 或放在壁龛中, 他们的打开只能在前面, 使它自然的, 为了显示雕塑的正面描绘. 其他雕塑被设计放在建筑环境中, 例如, 纪念性的大门入口到神殿的前面, 被称为塔门, 或者在柱形的庭院里, 在那里他们被放置在靠着柱子或者在柱子中间: 他们的正面描绘在建筑环境中有完美的效果.

段落主旨: 雕塑的材料
```

<font color='Salmon'>Stone</font> statues were worked from <font color='Salmon'>single rectangular blocks</font> of material and retained the <font color='Salmon'>compactness of the original shape</font>.

The arms could <font color='Salmon'>be held away from the body</font> and <font color='Salmon'>carry separate items in their hands</font>; there is <font color='Salmon'>no back pillar</font>. The effect is altogether lighter and freer than that achieved in stone, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> both perform the same function, <font color='Salmon'>formal wooden and metal statues</font> <font color='hotpink'>**still 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>display frontality</font>.

细节1: 石头 -> 长方形 | 胳膊和身体连着, 人物的腿之间连着 -> 预防破裂 | 力量感和权利感 <- 后柱支撑
细节2: 木头 -> 雕刻 | 钉在一起 <- 没有后柱支撑
细节3: 金属 -> 薄板包围木质核心 | 失蜡工艺 | 胳膊远离身体, 手拿东西 <- 没有后柱支撑

作用: 扮演相同功能 -> 展示正面描绘
```

??? quote "translation"
    雕塑通常由石头, 木头或金属制造.
    
    石头雕塑使用单一的长方形的材料块, 保留原生形状的紧凑. 胳膊和身体之间的石头, 在站着的人物的腿之间, 或坐着的人物的腿之间的石头, 通常不会切开. 从实践方面, 这保护的人物预防破裂, 从精神上的给图片力量和权利的感觉, 通常加强自支撑的后柱. 相比之下, 木质的雕塑由若干片木头雕刻而成, 把木头钉子一起形成完成的作品的, 金属雕塑也由包装薄板围绕着木质的核心制成, 或由失蜡工艺浇铸而成. 胳膊会被握住远离身体, 在他们手里拿着不同的东西; 没有后柱. 这个作用完全更轻更自由, 相比石头实现的, 但是因为这两个扮演相同的功能, 正式的木质的和金属的雕塑仍然展示正面描绘.

## Part 4 —— 另一功能 - 其他表现内容 —— 顺承Part2
==**Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and named members of the elite that can be called formal, there is <font color='Salmon'>another group of three-dimensional representations</font> that depicts generic figures, frequently servants, from the nonelite population.

    许多用来放在精英的坟墓中, 为了在来世服务坟墓的主人. 不像正式的雕塑, 被限制为站着, 坐着, 和跪着的静态姿势, 这些任务描述宽泛的行为, 如磨谷物, 烤面包, 生产锅盆, 和制作音乐, 他们展示适当的姿势, 弯腰的和蹲着的, 当他们进行他们的任务的时候

##### 6 修辞题目
> Paragraph 2: The majority of three-dimensional representations, whether standing, seated, or kneeling, exhibit what is called frontality: they face straight ahead, neither twisting nor turning. When such statues are viewed in isolation, out of their original context and without knowledge of their function, it is easy to criticize them for their rigid attitudes that remained unchanged for three thousand years. Frontality is, however, directly related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were set up. Statues were created not for their decorative effect but to play a primary role in the cults of the gods, the king, and the dead. They were designed to be put in places where these beings could manifest themselves in order to be the recipients of ritual actions. Thus it made sense to show the statue looking ahead at what was happening in front of it, so that the living performer of the ritual could interact with the divine or deceased recipient. Very often such statues were enclosed in rectangular shrines or wall niches whose ==only opening was at the front, making it natural for the statue to display frontality==. ==Other statues were designed to be placed within an architectural setting, for instance, in front of the monumental entrance gateways to temples known as pylons, or in pillared courts, where they would be placed against or between pillars: their frontality worked perfectly within the architectural context.==

> Paragraph 4: Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and named members of the elite that can be called formal, there is another group of three-dimensional representations that depicts generic figures, frequently servants, from the nonelite population. The function of these is quite different. Many are made to be put in the tombs of the elite in order to serve the tomb owners in the afterlife. Unlike formal statues that are limited to static poses of standing, sitting, and kneeling, these figures depict a wide range of actions, such as grinding grain, baking bread, producing pots, and making music, and they are shown in appropriate poses, bending and squatting as they carry out their tasks.
