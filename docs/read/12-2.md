    从无声到有声的转变在 1920 年代末, 到目前为止, 最重要的转变在动作电影历史中. 尽管所有高水平的可见技术的发展在戏剧的和家里的移动图片的传递, 发生在从那以后的几十年里的, 但是没有一个创新接近被视为一个类似的分水岭. 在几乎每种语言中, 然而这些词是被措辞的, 电影史的最基础的划分在缄默的和说话的影片中.

### 预判: 有声技术的介绍
## Part 2 —— 提出悖论 —— 顺承Part1
==**Yet this <font color='hotpink'>most 最高级 程度</font> fundamental standard of historical periodization conceals a host of <font color='Salmon'>paradoxes</font> `主旨`.**==

```
段落主旨: 隐藏悖论

下文可能会说悖论的细节
```

<font color='hotpink'>**Nearly every程度**</font> movie theater, <font color='Blue'>however 句内转折</font> modest, had a piano or organ to <font color='Salmon'>provide musical accompaniment</font> to silent pictures `现象`. In many instances, spectators in the era <font color='Salmon'>before</font> recorded sound experienced elaborate aural presentations <font color='Salmon'>alongside</font> movies' visual images, from the Japanese benshi (narrators) crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical compositions performed by symphony-size orchestras in Europe and the United States `进一步现象`. In Berlin, for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin, film director Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian composer Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on a musical score matching sound to image; the Berlin screenings with live music helped to <font color='Salmon'>bring the film its wide international fame</font> `举例`.

```
细节: 不管什么场景, 都有与图片共同表演的声音表演
范围: 日本对话节目 -> 欧美管乐队
影响: 获得国际声誉

没看懂与悖论的关系, 不知道是不是下文的铺垫内容
```

    但是, 这个最基本的历史周期的标准隐藏着大量悖论.
    
    几乎每部电影院, 然而不管多有节制, 都有一台钢琴或者乐器提供音乐伴奏给无声图片. 在许多情况下, 录制声音之前的时代的观众, 观看了与电影可视图片一同的精心制作的听觉表演, 从日本 benshi (解说员) 手动制作多种声音的对话叙述, 到原创音乐作品, 由欧美的交响乐规模的管弦乐队所表演的. 在柏林, 对于BP 的苏联外场地的首映表演, 电影导演 SE 和奥地利作曲家 EM (1874-1930) 在匹配声音到图片的音乐目标上一起工作; 有现场音乐帮助的柏林银屏带给影片广泛的国际声誉.

### 预判: 阐述悖论内容
## Part 3 —— 悖论内容 - 声音相对图画对电影的影响 —— 顺承Part2
<font color='Blue'>Beyond that 进一步</font>, the triumph of recorded <font color='Salmon'>sound has overshadowed</font> the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic <font color='Salmon'>experiments with the visual image</font> that were going forward simultaneously in the 1920s. 

```
段落主旨: 声音 > 可视的多样性尝试
时间: 1920s
```

<font color='Salmon'>New color processes</font>, larger or differently shaped screen sizes, multiple-screen projections, even television, were among the developments invented or tried out <font color='Salmon'>during</font> the period, sometimes with <font color='Salmon'>startling success</font>. The high costs of converting to sound and the early limitations of sound technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these other areas. The introduction of new screen formats was put off for a quarter century, and color, <font color='Blue'>though 让步转折</font> utilized over the next two decades for special productions, also did not become a norm until the 1950s.

```
细节: 新颜色过程有惊人的成功
声音的缺点: 成本高 | 早期被限制 <- 因素: 抑制创新 | 阻碍发展
影响: 新银幕格式被推迟 1/4 个世纪
发展: 1950s 前没有成为准则
```

??? quote "translation"
    除此之外, 录制的声音的成功盖过了技术的和美学的尝试的丰富多样性, 这些美学的尝试有同步进行的可视的图片, 在 1920 年代.
    
    新色彩过程, 更大或不同地形成银幕的尺寸, 多银幕的项目, 甚至电视, 在发明或在这个期间实验的发展中, 有时有惊人的成功. 转换到声音的高昂成本和早期声音技术的限制, 在这些因素中, 抑制创新或阻碍发展的, 在这些其他领域. 新银幕格式的引进被推迟了 1/4 个世纪, 并且色彩, 尽管使用了超过下一个二十年对于具体的产品, 但是也没有成为规则, 直到 1950 年代.

### 预判: {--声音技术的发展--} 否定悖论
## Part 4 —— 否定悖论 —— 顺承Part3
<font color='Blue'>Though 让步转折</font> it may <font color='Salmon'>be difficult to imagine</font> from a later perspective, a strain of <font color='Salmon'>critical opinion</font> in the 1920s predicted that sound film would <font color='Salmon'>be a technical novelty</font> that would <font color='Salmon'>soon fade</font> from sight, just <font color='Blue'>as 原因</font> had <font color='Salmon'>many previous attempts</font>, dating well back <font color='Salmon'>before</font> the First World War, to link images with recorded sound. 

```
段落主旨: 声音电影 -> 技术的新奇事物 -> 转折: 会很快消失
原因: 一战前的努力经验
```

These critics were making a common assumption—that <font color='Salmon'>the technological inadequacies</font> of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound amplification, fragile sound recordings) would invariably occur again. To be sure, their <font color='Salmon'>evaluation of the technical flaws</font> in 1920s sound experiments was <font color='Salmon'>not so far off the mark 否定</font>, <font color='Blue'>yet 句内转折</font> they neglected to take into account important new forces in the motion picture field that, in a sense, [new forces in the motion picture field的定语从句] would <font color='Salmon'>not take no for an answer 双重否定表肯定</font>.

```
细节1: 早期技术缺陷
细节2: 技术缺陷的革新 -> 没有偏差太远 -> 还可以
细节3: 忽视动作电影的新力量 -> 不给出否定答案 -> 因为忽略图片技术新力量, 而说是声音电影的不好, 这样不对
作用: 否定 part3 的悖论内容
```

??? quote "translation"
    尽管可能很难想象, 以后来的视角来看, 但是这种批判的观点在 1920 年代被描述为声音影片会是技术的新奇的事物, 会很快消失, 从视线中, 仅仅因为许多之前的努力, 可以追溯到第一次世界大战之前, 连接有录制声音的图片. 
    
    
    这些批评正作出普遍的假设, 早期努力的技术上的不足 (低劣的同步, 弱声增强, 弱声的录制) 一定再次发生. 可以肯定的是, 他们在 1920 年代的声音实验的技术缺陷的革新, 没有偏差太远, 然而他们忽略了考虑动作电影中的新力量, 从某种意义上来说, 不会给出否定的答案. 

### 预判: {--声音技术得到发展--} 阐述新力量是如何给出肯定答案的
## Part 5 —— 新力量的影响 —— 顺承Part4
<font color='Blue'>These forces 指代上段结尾图片中的新力量</font> were the <font color='hotpink'>**rapidly 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>expanding electronics and telecommunications companies</font> that were developing and linking telephone and wire<font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> technologies in the 1920s. In the United States, they included such firms as American Telephone and Telegraph, General Electric, and Westinghouse. They were interested in <font color='Salmon'>all forms of sound technology and all potential avenues for commercial exploitation</font>. Their competition and collaboration were <font color='Salmon'>creating the broadcasting industry</font> in the United States, beginning with the introduction of commercial radio programming in the early 1920s. With financial assets considerably greater than those in the motion picture industry, and perhaps a wider vision of the relationships among entertainment and communications media, they <font color='Salmon'>**revitalized research into recording sound**</font> for motion pictures.

细节1: 发展迅速
细节2: 对 所有声音技术 所欲商业开发的潜在途径 感兴趣
细节3: 重振录音研究

    这些力量快速地扩展到电子的和电讯公司, 发展并连接电话和无线电较少的技术的, 在 1920 年代. 在美国, 他们包含这些公司, 如美国电话电报, 通用电子, 和西部房屋. 他们感兴趣于所有声音技术的形式和所有用于商业开发的潜在途径. 他们的竞争和合作正在美国创造广播产业. 随着金融资产相当大的, 相比那些在动作电影产业来说, 也许娱乐和通讯媒体之间的关系的更宽的视野, 他们重新研究录制声音给动作电影.
    
### 预判: {--录音如何与图片电影相结合--} 有声电影的发展
## Part 6 —— 有声电影的发展 —— 顺承Part5
In 1929 the United States motion picture industry released <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>than 300</font> sound films—<font color='Salmon'>a rough figure</font>, since a number were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual versions, to take account of the many cinemas not yet wired for sound. At the production level, in the United States the conversion was <font color='hotpink'>**virtually 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>complete by 1930</font>. In Europe it took <font color='Salmon'>a little longer</font>, mainly <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> there were <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> <font color='Salmon'>small producers</font> for whom <font color='Salmon'>the costs of sound were prohibitive</font>, and in other parts of the world problems with <font color='Salmon'>rights or access to equipment</font> delayed the shift to sound production for <font color='Salmon'>a few <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词 程度**</font> years</font> (<font color='Blue'>though 让步转折</font> cinemas in major cities may have been wired in order to play foreign sound films). 

```
细节1: 美国 | 1929 年 | 发布量 > 300 - 粗略的数字
细节2: 美国 | 1930 年 | 几乎完成转换
细节3: 欧洲 | 时间稍长一点 <- 原因: 转换成本高昂 -> 小制造商负担不起 | 世界权利和访问设备的问题

==**The triumph of sound cinema was swift, complete, and enormously popular `主旨`.**==

段落主旨: 有声电影成功发展

    在 1929 年的米国动作电影产业发布超过 300 个录音电影- 一个粗略的数字, 因为一个数字是有音乐的无声电影, 或准备两个版本的电影, 考虑到许多电影院还没有接通声音电路. 在产品级别, 美国的转换差不多完成到 1930 年. 在欧洲, 这个耗时有点长, 主要因为有更小的生产者, 对于他们来说声音的成本太高, 在世界问题的其他部分中, 权利或访问推迟转换到声音产品的设备持续好几年 (尽管主要城市的电影院已经接通, 为了播放国外有声电影). 有声电影的成功是迅速的, 完全的, 并且极其流行.
