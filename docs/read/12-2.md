    从无声到有声的转变在 1920 年代末, 到目前为止, 最重要的转变在动作图片历史中. 尽管所有高水平的可见技术的发展在戏剧的和家里的移动图片的传递, 发生在从那以后的几十年里的, 但是没有一个创新接近被视为一个类似的分水岭. 在几乎每种语言中, 然而这些词是被措辞的, 电影史的最基础的划分在缄默的和说话的影片中.

    但是, 这个最基本的历史周期的标准隐藏着大量悖论.
    
    几乎每部电影院, 然而不管多有节制, 都有一台钢琴或者乐器提供音乐伴奏给无声图片. 在许多情况下, 录制声音之前的时代的观众, 观看了与电影可视图片一同的精心制作的听觉表演, 从日本 benshi (解说员) 手动制作多种声音的对话叙述, 到原创音乐作品, 由欧美的交响乐规模的管弦乐队所表演的. 在柏林, 对于BP 的苏联外场地的首映表演, 电影导演 SE 和奥地利作曲家 EM (1874-1930) 在匹配声音到图片的音乐目标上一起工作; 有现场音乐帮助的柏林银屏带给影片广泛的国际声誉.

<font color='Blue'>Though 让步转折</font> it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective, a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s predicted that sound film would be a technical novelty that would soon fade from sight, just as had many previous attempts, dating well back <font color='Salmon'>before</font> the First World War, to link images with recorded sound.

These critics were making a common assumption—that the technological inadequacies of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound amplification, fragile sound recordings) would invariably occur again. To be sure, their evaluation of the technical flaws in 1920s sound experiments was not so far off the mark, yet they neglected to take into account important new forces in the motion picture field that, in a sense, would not take no for an answer.

    尽管可能很难想象, 以后来的视角来看, 但是这种批判的观点在 1920 年代被描述为声音影片会是技术的新奇的事物, 会很快消失, 从视线中, 仅仅因为许多之前的努力, 可以追溯到第一次世界大战之前, 连接有录制声音的图片. 这些批评正作出普遍的假设, 早期努力的技术上的不足 (低劣的同步, 弱声增强, 弱声的录制) 一定再次发生. 可以肯定的是, 他们在1920 年代的声音实验的技术缺陷的革新, 没有偏离太远, 然而他们忽略把重要的动作图片中的新力量考虑进去, 从某种意义上来说, 不会给出否定的答案.

These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommunications companies that were developing and linking telephone and wire<font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> technologies in the 1920s. In the United States, they included such firms as American Telephone and Telegraph, General Electric, and Westinghouse. They were interested in all forms of sound technology and all potential avenues for commercial exploitation. Their competition and collaboration were creating the broadcasting industry in the United States, beginning with the introduction of commercial radio programming in the early 1920s. With financial assets considerably greater than those in the motion picture industry, and perhaps a wider vision of the relationships among entertainment and communications media, they revitalized research into recording sound for motion pictures.

> Paragraph 2: Yet this most fundamental standard of historical periodization conceals a host of paradoxes. Nearly every movie theater, however modest, had a piano or organ to provide musical accompaniment to silent pictures. In many instances, spectators in the era before recorded sound experienced elaborate aural presentations alongside movies' visual images, from the Japanese benshi (narrators) crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical compositions performed by symphony-size orchestras in Europe and the United States.
