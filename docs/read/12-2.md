    从无声到有声的转变在 1920 年代末, 到目前为止, 最重要的转变在动作图片历史中. 尽管所有高水平的可见技术的发展在戏剧的和家里的移动图片的传递, 发生在从那以后的几十年里的, 但是没有一个创新接近被视为一个类似的分水岭. 在几乎每种语言中, 然而这些词是被措辞的, 电影史的最基础的划分在缄默的和说话的影片中.

Yet this most fundamental standard of historical periodization conceals a host of paradoxes. Nearly every movie theater, <font color='Blue'>however 句内转折</font> modest, had a piano or organ to provide musical accompaniment to silent pictures. In many instances, spectators in the era <font color='Salmon'>before</font> recorded sound experienced elaborate aural presentations <font color='Salmon'>alongside</font> movies' visual images, from the Japanese benshi (narrators) crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical compositions performed by symphony-size orchestras in Europe and the United States. In Berlin, for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin, film director Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian composer Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on a musical score matching sound to image; the Berlin screenings with live music helped to bring the film its wide international fame.

Beyond that, the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic experiments with the visual image that were going forward simultaneously in the 1920s. New color processes, larger or differently shaped screen sizes, multiple-screen projections, even television, were among the developments invented or tried out <font color='Salmon'>during</font> the period, sometimes with startling success. The high costs of converting to sound and the early limitations of sound technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these other areas. The introduction of new screen formats was put off for a quarter century, and color, <font color='Blue'>though 让步转折</font> utilized over the next two decades for special productions, also did not become a norm until the 1950s.

<font color='Blue'>Though 让步转折</font> it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective, a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s predicted that sound film would be a technical novelty that would soon fade from sight, just as had many previous attempts, dating well back <font color='Salmon'>before</font> the First World War, to link images with recorded sound. These critics were making a common assumption—that the technological inadequacies of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound amplification, fragile sound recordings) would invariably occur again. To be sure, their evaluation of the technical flaws in 1920s sound experiments was not so far off the mark, yet they neglected to take into account important new forces in the motion picture field that, in a sense, would not take no for an answer.

These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommunications companies that were developing and linking telephone and wire<font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> technologies in the 1920s. In the United States, they included such firms as American Telephone and Telegraph, General Electric, and Westinghouse. They were interested in all forms of sound technology and all potential avenues for commercial exploitation. Their competition and collaboration were creating the broadcasting industry in the United States, beginning with the introduction of commercial radio programming in the early 1920s. With financial assets considerably greater than those in the motion picture industry, and perhaps a wider vision of the relationships among entertainment and communications media, they revitalized research into recording sound for motion pictures.

In 1929 the United States motion picture industry released <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> than 300 sound films—a rough figure, since a number were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual versions, to take account of the many cinemas not yet wired for sound.

The triumph of sound cinema was swift, complete, and enormously popular.
