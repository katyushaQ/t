## 文章结构思路: 
## Part 1 —— 沙漠中的降雨
==**Rainfall is <font color='hotpink'>not completely 程度副词 否定</font> <font color='Salmon'>absent 否定</font> in desert areas, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> it is <font color='hotpink'>highly 程度副词</font> variable `主旨`.**==

```
双重否定表肯定
段落主旨: 沙漠有降雨，但是多变的 
[基于什么变? 就有降水? 可能是要讲的内容]
```

<span style="background: #D9FFFF">
An annual rainfall of four inches is <font color='Salmon'>often</font> used to define the limits of a desert. `顺承，细节，介绍` The impact of rainfall upon the surface water *and* groundwater resources of the desert is <font color='hotpink'>**greatly 程度副词**</font> influenced by landforms. `顺承，细节，影响` Flats and depressions where water can collect are <font color='Salmon'>common features</font>, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> they make up <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> a <font color='hotpink'>**small 程度形容词**</font> part of the landscape. `顺承，举例`

```
降雨量衡量沙漠
细节: 地貌影响水的聚集
举例: 洼地地形普遍积水【也就是说，非洼地很难积水，容易流走】
```

??? attention "sentence"

    Rainfall is not completely absent in desert areas, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> it is highly variable.
    > 在沙漠地区，降雨不是完全的没有，但是是极度可变的。

    An annual rainfall of four inches is often used to define the limits of a desert.
    > 一年4英寸厚的降雨，通常用来定义一个沙漠的限度。

    The impact of rainfall {++upon the surface water++} *and* groundwater`地下水` resources of the desert is greatly influenced by landforms`地形，地貌`.
    > 表面水上面的降雨和沙漠的地下水资源的影响，极大地被地形影响。
    
    !!! failure ""
        and 并列的是谁？impact 和 groundwater？还是 surface water 和 groundwater？我觉得是后者

    Flats`低洼地，浅滩` and depressions`洼地` where water can collect are common features, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> they make up`形成` <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> a small part of the landscape.
    > 水能够集中的浅滩和洼地是普遍的特征，但是他们只形成地貌的一小部分。

### 预判: 沙漠除了降雨,还有其他水吧?说其他水?
## Part 2 —— 干燥地区的河流 —— 并列Part1
