```
铺垫: 关系产生的基础条件
```

==**When an association continues <font color='Salmon'>long</font> <font color='hotpink'>enough 程度</font> for two people to become <font color='Salmon'>linked together</font> by a <font color='hotpink'>relatively 程度</font><font color='Salmon'> stable set of expectations</font>, it is called a relationship `主旨`.**==

    生活使我们处在一个与他人复杂的关系网中. 我们人类在社会交互的情况下的这些关系所产生. 然而, 我们人类必须通过社会交互维持 - 而且是相当持续的.
    
    当联系持续足够长, 对于 2 个人来说会变成连在一起, 由相对稳定的一套期望, 它被称为关系.

## Part 2 —— 关系的 2 个类型 —— 顺承Part1
==**People are bound within relationships by <font color='Salmon'>two types</font> of bonds: <font color='Salmon'>expressive ties and instrumental ties</font> `主旨`.**==

```
段落主旨: 2 个类型 -> expressive ties | instrumental tie
```

Expressive ties are social links formed when we <font color='Salmon'>emotionally invest ourselves in</font> and <font color='Salmon'>commit ourselves to other people</font> `描述`. Through association with people who are meaningful to us, we achieve a sense of security, love, acceptance, companionship, and personal worth `解释`. 

```
expressive ties
细节: 投入自己的情感 | 将自己对他人做出保证
```

Instrumental ties are social links formed when we <font color='Salmon'>cooperate with other people to achieve some goal</font> `描述`. <font color='hotpink'>**Occasionally 程度 场景**</font>, this may mean <font color='Salmon'>working with instead of against competitors</font> `特殊描述`. <font color='hotpink'>**More often 对比 场景**</font>, we <font color='hotpink'>**simply 程度**</font> cooperate with others to <font color='Salmon'>reach some end</font> without endowing the relationship with any larger significance `进一步`.

```
instrumental tie
细节: 完成目标 | 偶然 -> 与竞争者合作 | 普遍 -> 只为达到结果
```

??? quote "translation"
    人们在关系中建立紧密联系, 由 2 个类型的紧密联系: 富有情感的关系和有用的关系.
    
    富有情感的关系是社交的连接, 形成于我们投入我们自己的感情和将自己对他人做出保证的时候. 通过与对我们有意义的人们的联系, 我们获得安全感, 爱, 认可, 友谊和个人价值.
    
    有用的关系是社交的连接, 形成于我们与他人合作完成一些目标的时候. 偶然, 这个可能意思是与竞争者一起工作而不是反对. 更多时候, 我们只是与他人合作达到一些结果, 没有资助的有任何更大意义的关系的条件下.

## Part 3 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Sociologists have built on the distinction between expressive and instrumental ties to distinguish between two types of groups: primary and secondary. A primary group involves two or <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> people who enjoy a direct, intimate, cohesive relationship with one another. Expressive ties predominate in primary groups; we view the people as ends in themselves and valuable in their own right. A secondary group entails two or <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> people who are involved in an impersonal relationship and have come together for a specific, practical purpose. Instrumental ties predominate in secondary groups; we perceive people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right. Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out of secondary group relationships. This happens in many work settings. People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes, jokes, gossip, and satisfactions.

## Part 4 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
A number of conditions enhance the likelihood that primary groups will arise. First, group size is important. We find it difficult to get to know people personally when they are milling about and dispersed in large groups. In small groups we have a better chance to initiate contact and establish rapport with them. Second, face-to-face contact allows us to size up others. Seeing and talking with one another in close physical proximity makes possible a subtle exchange of ideas and feelings. And third, the probability that we will develop primary group bonds increases as we have frequent and continuous contact. Our ties with people often deepen as we interact with them across time and gradually evolve interlocking habits and interests.

## Part 5 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Primary groups are fundamental to us and to society. First, primary groups are critical to the socialization process. Within them, infants and children are introduced to the ways of their society. Such groups are the breeding grounds in which we acquire the norms and values that equip us for social life. Sociologists view primary groups as bridges between individuals and the larger society <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> they transmit, mediate, and interpret a society's cultural patterns and provide the sense of oneness so critical for social solidarity.

Second, primary groups are fundamental <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> they provide the settings in which we meet most of our personal needs. Within them, we experience companionship, love, security, and an overall sense of well-being. Not surprisingly, sociologists find that the strength of a group's primary ties has implications for the group's functioning. For example, the stronger the primary group ties of a sports team playing together, the better their record is.

Third, primary groups are fundamental <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> they serve as powerful instruments for social control. Their members command and dispense many of the rewards that are so vital to us and that make our lives seem worthwhile. Should the use of rewards fail, members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who deviate from the primary group's norms. For instance, some social groups employ shunning (a person can remain in the community, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> others are forbidden to interact with the person) as a device to bring into line individuals whose behavior goes beyond that allowed by the particular group. Even <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> important, primary groups define social reality for us by structuring our experiences. By providing us with definitions of situations, they elicit from our behavior that conforms to group-devised meanings. Primary groups, then, serve both as carriers of social norms and as enforcers of them.
