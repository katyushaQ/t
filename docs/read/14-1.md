## Part 1 —— 摘要孩子, 广告, 广告对孩子的影响 [大背景]
<font color='Salmon'>Young children</font> are <font color='Salmon'>trusting of commercial advertisements</font> in the media, and <font color='Salmon'>advertisers</font> have sometimes <font color='Salmon'>been accused of taking advantage of this trusting outlook</font>. The Independent Television Commission, regulator of television advertising in the United Kingdom, has criticized <font color='Salmon'>advertisers for "misleadingness"</font>—<font color='Salmon'>creating a wrong impression</font> either intentionally or unintentionally—in an effort to control advertisers' use of techniques that make it <font color='Salmon'>difficult for children to judge</font> the true size, action, performance, or construction of a toy.

    年轻的孩子相信媒体中的商业广告, 并且广告商有时被指控利用这些信任的情况. 独立电视委员会, 英国电视广告监管者, 批判广告商对于 "误导" - 创造错误的表达, 或有意或无意地 - 在努力控制广告商的技术的使用, 这些技术使孩子很难判断玩具真实的大小, 动作, 表现, 或者结构.

### 预判: 为什么孩子信任带误导的广告
## Part 2 —— 商家的广告策略及孩子的理解能力 —— 顺承Part1
==**General concern about <font color='Salmon'>misleading tactics</font> that advertisers employ is centered on <font color='Salmon'>the use of exaggeration</font> `主旨`.**==

```
段落主旨: 误导的策略被集中夸张的运用
```

Consumer protection groups and parents believe that children are largely <font color='Salmon'>ill-equipped to recognize</font> such techniques and that often exaggeration is used at the expense of product information. Claims such as "<font color='hotpink'>**the best 最高级**</font>" or "better than" can be <font color='Salmon'>subjective and misleading</font>; even adults may be <font color='Salmon'>unsure as to their meaning</font> `解释`. They <font color='Salmon'>represent the advertiser's opinions</font> about the qualities of their products or brand and, as a consequence, are <font color='Salmon'>difficult to verify</font>. Advertisers sometimes offset or counterbalance an exaggerated claim <font color='Salmon'>with a disclaimer</font>—a qualification or condition on the claim `解释`. <font color='Blue'>For example 举例</font>, the claim that breakfast cereal has a health benefit may be accompanied by the disclaimer "when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast." `举例` <font color='Blue'>However 句间转折</font>, research has shown that <font color='Salmon'>children often have difficulty understanding disclaimer</font>s: children may interpret the phrase "when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast" to mean that the cereal is required as a necessary part of a balanced breakfast `解释`. The author George Comstock suggested that <font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> than a quarter of children between the ages of six and eight years old <font color='Salmon'>understood standard disclaimers</font> used in many toy advertisements and that disclaimers are <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> readily comprehended <font color='Salmon'>when presented in both audio and visual formats</font> `结论`. <font color='Blue'>Nevertheless 句间转折</font>, disclaimers are mainly presented <font color='Salmon'>in audio format</font> <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> `进一步结论`.

细节1: 孩子识别能力差 | 夸张是产品的代价
细节2: 声明是 主观的 | 误导的
细节3: 商家有免责声明 <- 孩子很难理解
细节4: 音频+视频 可以理解 | 而主要免责在音频中 -> 不容易理解
```

??? quote "translation"
    普遍关心广告商雇佣的误导的策略集中于夸张的运用. 
    
    消费者保护组织和家长认为, 孩子非常弱能力识别这些技术, 夸张的技术常常被使用以损害产品信息为代价. 声称这些 "最好" 或 "更好" 能是主观的和误导的; 甚至成人也会不能确定他们的意思. 他们代表广告商的观点, 关于他们产品或品牌的质量, 作为后果, 很难验证. 广告商有时用免责声明补偿或抵消夸张的声明 - 一个在声明上的资格和条件. 例如, 早餐麦片对健康有益的声明也许附有免责声明 "当部分的营养均衡的早餐的时候". 然而, 研究表明孩子们常常很难理解免责声明: 孩子们会解释短语 "当部分的营养均衡的早餐的时候" 的意思为麦片是需要的, 作为必要部分的均衡早餐. 作者 GC提议在 6-8 岁的少于四分之一的孩子理解标准的用于许多玩具广告中的免责声明, 并且免责声明更容易领会, 当在音频和可视的形式中表现的时候. 然而, 免责声明主要只表现在音频形式中.

### 预判: 细化夸张策略及孩子的反应
## Part 3 —— 幻想技术及孩子对它的反应 —— 顺承Part2
==**<font color='Salmon'>Fantasy</font> is one of the <font color='hotpink'>more 比较词</font> <font color='Salmon'>common techniques</font> in advertising that could possibly <font color='Salmon'>mislead a young audience</font> `主旨`.**==

```
段落主旨: 幻想 -> 误导年轻人
```

Child-oriented advertisements are <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> likely to <font color='Salmon'>include magic and fantasy</font> than advertisements aimed at adults `解释`. In a content analysis of Canadian television, the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all commercials for character toys featured fantasy play `现象`. Children have <font color='Salmon'>strong imaginations</font> and the use of fantasy brings their ideas to life, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> children may <font color='Salmon'>not be adept</font> <font color='hotpink'>**enough 程度**</font> to <font color='Salmon'>realize that what they are viewing is unreal</font> `结论`. Fantasy situations and settings are <font color='hotpink'>**frequently 程度**</font> used to <font color='Salmon'>attract children's attention</font>, particularly in <font color='Salmon'>food advertising</font> `描述`. Advertisements for breakfast cereals have, for many years, been found to be especially fond of fantasy techniques, with <font color='hotpink'>**almost 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'> nine out of ten</font> including such content `进一步描述`. Generally, there is <font color='hotpink'>**uncertainty 程度**</font> as to <font color='Salmon'>whether</font> very young children can <font color='Salmon'>distinguish between fantasy and reality</font> in advertising `问题让步`. Certainly, rational appeals in advertising aimed at children <font color='Salmon'>are limited</font>, as most advertisements use <font color='Salmon'>emotional and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations</font> `客观事实`.

细节1: 魔幻和幻想 > 成人广告
细节2: 玩具 食物

    幻想是一个更普遍的广告技术之一, 这个广告可能误导年轻观众. 
    
    朝向孩子的广告更可能包含魔幻和幻想, 相比针对成人的广告. 在加拿大电视的内容分析中, 作者 SK 发现几乎所有的商业广告为了以幻想游戏为特征的特点玩具. 孩子有很强的想象力, 幻想的使用地给他们带来对生命的想法, 但是孩子无法足够熟练的意识到他们所看到的是不真实的. 幻想的情况和环境频繁的用于吸引孩子们的注意, 特别在食物广告中. 对于早餐麦片的广告, 持续许多年, 被发现尤其喜欢幻想技术, 几乎9/10包含这些内容. 通常, 不确定对于非常年轻的孩子是否能够区分广告中的幻想和现实. 当然, 针对孩子的广告中合理的吸引力是有限的, 大多数广告使用情感和间接的对于心理状态和关联的吸引力.

==**The use of <font color='Salmon'>celebrities</font> such as singers and movie stars is <font color='hotpink'>common 程度</font> in advertising `主旨`.**==

<font color='Salmon'>The intention</font> is for the positively perceived <font color='Salmon'>attributes</font> of the celebrity to be <font color='Salmon'>transferred to the advertised product</font> and for the two to become <font color='hotpink'>**automatically 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>linked in the audience's mind</font>. In children's advertising, the "celebrities" are often <font color='Salmon'>animated figures</font> from popular cartoons. In the recent past, the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been <font color='Salmon'>conflated with the concept of host selling</font>. Host selling involves <font color='Salmon'>blending advertisements with regular programming</font> in a way that makes it <font color='Salmon'>difficult to distinguish one from the other</font>. Host selling occurs, <font color='Blue'>for example, 举例</font> when a children's show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast cereal. The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host selling <font color='Salmon'>reduced children's ability to distinguish</font> between advertising and program material. It was also found that <font color='Salmon'>older children</font> responded <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> <font color='hotpink'>**positively 程度**</font> to products in host selling advertisements.

细节1: 理解名人态度 -> 转变到广告 -> 观众连接名人与产品
细节2: 主持人销售 -> 混合广告与正规节目 -> 降低孩子的辨别力 | 年龄大的孩子反应更积极

>Paragraph 2: General concern about misleading tactics that advertisers employ is centered on the use of exaggeration. Consumer protection groups and parents believe that children are largely ill-equipped to recognize such techniques and that often exaggeration is used at the expense of product information. Claims such as "the best" or "better than" can be subjective and misleading; even adults may be unsure as to their meaning. They represent the advertiser's opinions about the qualities of their products or brand and, as a consequence, are difficult to verify. Advertisers sometimes offset or counterbalance an exaggerated claim with a disclaimer—a qualification or condition on the claim. For example, the claim that breakfast cereal has a health benefit may be accompanied by the disclaimer "when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast." However, research has shown that children often have difficulty understanding disclaimers: children may interpret the phrase "when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast" to mean that the cereal is required as a necessary part of a balanced breakfast. The author George Comstock suggested that less than a quarter of children between the ages of six and eight years old understood standard disclaimers used in many toy advertisements and that disclaimers are more readily comprehended when presented in both audio and visual formats. Nevertheless, disclaimers are mainly presented in audio format only.

> Paragraph 4: The use of celebrities such as singers and movie stars is common in advertising. The intention is for the positively perceived attributes of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the audience's mind. In children's advertising, the "celebrities" are often animated figures from popular cartoons. In the recent past, the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the concept of host selling. Host selling involves blending advertisements with regular programming in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other. Host selling occurs, for example, when a children's show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast cereal. The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host selling reduced children's ability to distinguish between advertising and program material. It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in host selling advertisements.
