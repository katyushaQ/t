    Glaciers are <font color='hotpink'>**slowly 比较词**</font> moving masses of ice that have accumulated on land in areas where <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> snowfalls <font color='Salmon'>during</font> a year than melts.
    > 冰川是缓慢地移动的冰块，这个冰块已经积累成陆地，在这个区域在一年中更多的降雪比融化要多。

    Snow falls as hexagonal`六边形的` crystals, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> once on the ground, snow is soon transformed into`变形，转变` a compacted mass of smaller, rounded`使成圆形的` grains`颗粒`.
    > 雪落下来成为六边形的水晶，但是一旦落地，雪很快变成压缩的一小块，使成为圆形的颗粒。

    As the air space around them is <font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font>ened by compaction and melting, the grains become denser.
    > 在压缩和融化的结尾，当空气空间围绕他们更少的时候，颗粒会更密集。

    With further melting, refreezing, and increased weight from newer snowfall above, the snow reaches a granular`颗粒状的` recrystallized stage intermediate`中间的` between flakes and ice known as firn`积雪`.
    > 随着进一步的融化、再冻结和来自上面新降雪增加的重量，雪达到一个颗粒状的再结晶中间阶段，在小薄片和冰之间，成为积雪。

    With additional time, pressure, and refrozen meltwater from above, the small firn granules become larger, interlocked`紧密连接` crystals of blue glacial ice.
    > 随着额外的时间、压力和来自上面的再冻结的融化水，颗粒状的小积雪变得更大、成为紧密连接的蓝色冰川冰水晶。

    When the ice is thick enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become plastic and to flow outward or downward from the area of snow accumulation.
    > 当冰足够厚的时候，通常超过30米，雪和积雪的重量会导致冰晶朝着底部变成塑料状，并且从积雪的地方向外或向下流出。

For a glacier to grow or maintain its mass, there must be sufficient snowfall to match or exceed the annual loss through melting, evaporation, and calving, which occurs when the glacier loses solid chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes. `顺承，细节，现象` If summer temperatures are high for too long, then all the snowfall from the previous winter will melt. `顺承，举例，进一步` Surplus snowfall is essential for a glacier to develop. A surplus allows snow to accumulate and for the pressure of snow accumulated over the years to transform buried snow into glacial ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow. Glaciers are sometimes classified by temperature as faster-flowing temperate glaciers or as slower-flowing polar glaciers.

Glaciers are part of Earth’s hydrologic cycle and are second <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> to the oceans in the total amount of water contained. About 2 percent of Earth’s water is currently frozen as ice. Two percent may be a deceiving figure, <font color='Blue'>however 句内转折</font>, since over 80 percent of the world’s freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers, with the majority of it in Antarctica. The total amount of ice is even <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> awesome if we estimate the water released upon the hypothetical melting of the world’s glaciers. Sea level would rise about 60 meters. This would change the geography of the planet considerably.

    Directions: An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below. Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage. This question is worth 2 points.
    
    Glaciers are part of Earth's hydrologic cycle.
    
    A.Glaciers, which at present contain 80 percent of Earth's freshwater, form when accumulated snow is compressed and recrystallized into ice over a period of years.
    
    B.When there are glaciers on Earth, water is cycled through the glacier system, but the cycle period may be hundreds of thousands of years during periods of ice ages.
    
    C.The glacial system is governed by precipitation and temperature in such a way that glaciers cannot form in temperate latitudes.
    
    D.When glacial ice reaches a depth of 30 meters, the weight of the ice causes ice crystals at the bottom to flow, and the resulting movement of the glacier carves the landscape.
    
    E.If global warming melted the world's glaciers, sea level would rise about 60 meters worldwide.
    
    F.Glaciers have had little effect on Earth's surface because only 2 percent of Earth's water is currently contained in glaciers, and there are fewer glaciers now than at most times in the past.
