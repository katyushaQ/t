    The planets in our solar system fall into`属于，分为` two groups: the terrestrial`地球的` (Earth-like) planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian`木星的` (Jupiter-like) planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
    > 我们太阳系的星球分为两组：累地行星（水星，金星，地球和火星）和类木行星（木星，土星，天王星和海王星）。

    > 冥王星不属于这两类，因为他和太阳有极大的距离，并且他的小尺寸使这个星球的真实本性是一个迷。

    <font color='hotpink'>**The most 最高级**</font> obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size.
    > 最明显的不同，在类地和类木行星直接的区别是他们的大小。

    The largest terrestrial planet, Earth has a diameter`直径` <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> one quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest Jovian planet, Neptune, and its mass is <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> one seventeenth as great.

    Hence, the Jovian planets are often called giants`巨人`.
    > 因此，类木行星常常被称作巨星。

    Also, <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> of their relative locations, the four Jovian planets are known as`被认为是` the outer planets, while the terrestrial planets are known as the inner planets.
    > 同时，因为他们相对的位置，4个类木行星被认为是外部行星，然而类地行星被认为是内部行星。

    There appears to be`似乎` a correlation`相关性` between the positions of these planets and their sizes.
    > 似乎在这些星球的位置和大小之间存在相关性。

## Part 4 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia. By comparison, the terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at best. A planet's ability to retain an atmosphere depends on its temperature and mass. Simply stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity. For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per second. Any material, including a rocket, must reach this speed <font color='Salmon'>before</font> it can leave Earth and go into space. The Jovian planets, <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities, have higher escape velocities (21-60 kilometers per second) than the terrestrial planets. Consequently, it is <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> difficult for gases to "evaporate" from them. Also, <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> the molecular motion of a gas depends on temperature, at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape. On the other hand, a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere. The slightly larger terrestrial planets Earth, Venus, and Mars retain some heavy gases like carbon dioxide, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> even their atmospheres make up <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> an infinitesimally small portion of their total mass.

## Part 5 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
