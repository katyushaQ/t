## 文章结构思路: [三个事物 A, B and C]
## Part 1 —— 介绍生态学 [大背景]
==**In <font color='Salmon'>the late nineteenth</font> century, ecology began to grow into an <font color='Salmon'>independent science</font> from its roots in natural history and plant geography `主旨`.**== 

```
段落主旨: 生态学 => 独立科学 | <= 自然历史 和 植物地质
```

The emphasis of this new "community ecology" was on the composition and structure of communities consisting of different species `解释`. In <font color='Salmon'>the early twentieth</font> century, the American <font color='Salmon'>ecologist Frederic Clements</font> pointed out that <font color='Salmon'>a succession of plant communities would develop</font> <font color='Salmon'>after</font> a disturbance such as a volcanic eruption, heavy flood, or forest fire `进一步解释`. An abandoned field, <font color='Blue'>for instance, 举例</font> will be invaded successively by herbaceous plants (plants with little or no woody tissue), shrubs, and trees, eventually becoming a forest `举例` `举例`. Light-loving species are always among <font color='hotpink'>**the first 最高级**</font> invaders, while shade-tolerant species appear later in the succession `例子产生的现象`.

```
细节: 不同种类群体的组成和结构
现象: 喜爱光线的种类 = 入侵者 | 庇荫处的 = 出现晚
```

??? quote "translation"
    在19世纪末, 生态学开始成长为独立科学, 从它在自然历史和植物地质中的起源. 
    
    这个新 "社群生态" 的重点是在由不同种类组成的群体的组成和结构上. 在18世纪早期, 美国生态学家 FC 指出, 植物群体的演替会在一个如火山爆发, 大洪水, 或森林火灾后发展. 一个废弃的地区, 例如, 会被草本植物(几乎没有或没有木质组织的植物), 灌木和树连续地涌入, 最终变成一片森林. 喜爱光线的品种总是在入侵者之中, 然而能在庇荫处的种类在演替中出现的比较晚.

### 预判: 上段最后提到演替, 下段讲演替
## Part 2 —— 介绍演替 [A] —— 顺承Part1
==**Clements and other early ecologists saw almost <font color='Salmon'>lawlike regularity in the order of succession</font>, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> that <font color='Salmon'>has not been substantiated</font>. A general trend can be recognized, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> the details are usually <font color='Salmon'>unpredictable</font> `主旨`.**== 

```
段落主旨: 引出演替
特征: 顺序中的似规律性
问题: 没有被证实
现在: 细节不可预测
```

Succession is influenced by <font color='Salmon'>many factors 超过3个</font>: the nature of the soil, exposure to sun and wind, regularity of precipitation, chance colonizations, and many other random processes `描述`.

```
细节: 影响演替的因素
```

??? quote "translation"
    C 和其他早期生态学家看到几乎在演替的顺序中的似规律性, 但是这个说法还没有被证实. 一个通常的趋势能被认知, 但是细节往往不可预测的.
    
    演替被许多因素影响: 突然的性质, 太阳和风的照射, 降雨的规律性, 机会殖民和血多其他随机的变化过程.
    
### 预判: {--详细阐述演替的影响因素--} 介绍顶峰
## Part 3 —— 介绍顶峰 [B] —— 顺承Part2
==**<font color='Salmon'>The final stage</font> of a succession, called the <font color='Salmon'>climax</font> by Clements and early ecologists, is likewise <font color='Salmon'>not predictable or of uniform composition</font> `主旨`.**==

```
段落主旨: 引出顶峰
属性: 演替的最终阶段
特征: 不可以测, 不一致的组成部分
```

There is <font color='hotpink'>**usually 程度**</font> <font color='hotpink'>**a good deal of 程度**</font> turnover in species composition, even in a mature community `描述`. The nature of the climax is influenced by the <font color='Salmon'>same factorsthat influenced succession</font> `进一步描述`. <font color='Blue'>Nevertheless 转折</font>, mature natural environments are <font color='hotpink'>**usually 程度**</font> in equilibrium `转折, 现象`. They <font color='Salmon'>change relatively little</font> through time <font color='Salmon'>unless the environment itself changes</font>.

```
细节: 流动率高 <-> 种类中
影响因素: 与演替相同

转折: 成熟环境 => 均衡 | 不包括环境自身改变 
```

??? quote "translation"
    一个演替的最终阶段, 由 C 和早期生态学家叫做顶峰, 同样地不可以测或者不一致的组成部分. 
    
    通常在种类组成中有大量的流动, 甚至在成熟的社群中. 顶峰的性质是被影响演替的相同因素所影响. 尽管如此, 成熟自然环境通常是均衡的. 他们通过时间相对没有改变, 除非环境自己改变.

### 预判: {--顶峰与生态系统的关系--} 继续说顶峰
## Part 4 —— 阐述顶峰的争议 [经历的事情] —— 顺承/并列Part
For Clements, the climax was a <font color='Salmon'>"superorganism,"</font> an organic entity `铺垫`. **Even some authors who accepted the climax concept <font color='Salmon'>rejected</font> Clements' characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is <font color='Salmon'>indeed a misleading metaphor</font> `主旨`.** 

```
段落主旨: C 的超级生物描述, 属于误导比喻
```

An ant colony may be <font color='hotpink'>**legitimately 程度**</font> called a superorganism <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> its communication system is <font color='Salmon'>so highly organized</font> that the colony always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances `举例`. <font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> there is <font color='Salmon'>no evidence for</font> such an interacting communicative network <font color='Salmon'>in a climax plant formation</font> `转折`. Many authors prefer the term <font color='Salmon'>"association" to the term "community"</font> in order to <font color='Salmon'>stress the looseness of the interaction</font> `解释`. 

```
细节: 蚂蚁符合超级生物

转折: 植物 <= 没有证据

举例细节: 引出联盟
```

??? quote "translation"
    对于 C, 顶峰是 "超级生物" , 一个有机的实体. 甚至一些接受顶峰概念的作者拒绝它作为一个超级生物的 C 的特性描述, 并且它的确是一个误导的比喻. 
    
    蚂蚁群落也许是被合理的称为一个超级生物, 因为它们的群落系统是被非常高度组织的, 群落总是作为整体恰当地根据情况工作. 但是对于这些在顶峰植物形成中相互交流的网络没有证据. 许多作者喜欢术语 "联盟" 甚于 "群体", 为了强调交互的宽松. 

### 预判: {--顶峰对生态的影响--} 顺畅上一段继续说, 然后提出反方观点
## Part 5 —— 生物群落与种类分布影响因素 [经历的事情] —— 顺承Part4
Even <font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> fortunate was <font color='Salmon'>the extension</font> of this type of thinking to include <font color='Salmon'>animals as well as plants</font> `顺承, 进一步解释`. This resulted in the <font color='Salmon'>"biome,"语</font> a combination of coexisting flora and fauna `结论`. <font color='Blue'>Though 让步转折</font> it is true that many animals are strictly associated with certain plants, it is misleading to speak of a "spruce-moose biome," for example, <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> there is <font color='Salmon'>no internal cohesion</font> to their association as in an organism `进一步说明误导`. The spruce community is not substantially affected by either the presence or absence of moose `现象`. <font color='Blue'>Indeed 进一步</font>, there are vast areas of spruce forest <font color='Salmon'>without moose</font> `现象结论`. <font color='Blue'>The opposition</font> to the Clementsian concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert Gleason, soon joined by various other ecologists `解释`. 

```
细节: 动植物的延伸 => 生物群落
```

Their <font color='Salmon'>major point</font> was that <font color='Salmon'>the distribution of a given species</font> was controlled by <font color='Salmon'>the habitat requirements of that species</font> and that <font color='Blue'>therefore 因果</font> the vegetation types were <font color='Salmon'>a simple consequence of the ecologies of individual plant species</font> `观点`.

```
段落主旨: 种类的分布 <= 种类的生活环境
结论: 植物类型 <= 个体植物种类的结果
```

??? quote "translation"
    甚至较少的巧合是这个类型认为包含动物以及植物的延伸.这个导致 "生物群落", 一个共存的植物群和动物群的组合. 尽管许多动物被完全地与某些植物联系是真的, 但是例如说明一个 "杉木驼鹿的生物群落"是误导的, 因为作为一个生物, 他们的联系没有内部的凝聚力. 杉木群落大体上不被骆驼的出现或消失所影响. 确实, 杉木林有巨大的地区没有驼鹿. 对 C 的植物生态学概念反对的意见是由 HC 发起的, 很快加入了不同的其他生态学家. 
    
    他们的主要观点是指定种类的分布是由种类的生活环境需要所控制, 因此植物类型是个体植物种类的生态学的一个简单的结果.
    
### 预判: {--阐述种类的生活环境, 解释上一段最后一句--} 生态系统
## Part 6 —— 介绍生态系统 [C] —— 顺承Part5
==**With "climax," "biome," "superorganism," and various other technical terms for the association of animals and plants at a given locality being criticized, the term <font color='Salmon'>"ecosystem"</font> was <font color='hotpink'>more 比较词</font> and <font color='hotpink'>more 比较词</font> widely adopted for the whole system of associated organisms together with the physical factors of their environment `主旨`.**== 

```
段落主旨: 引出生态系统
```

<font color='Blue'>Eventually 结论</font>, <font color='Salmon'>the energy-transforming role of such a system</font> was emphasized `结论`. Ecosystems thus involve the <font color='Salmon'>circulation, transformation, and accumulation of energy</font> and matter through the medium of living things and their activities `描述`. The ecologist is concerned primarily with <font color='Salmon'>the quantities of matter and energy</font> that pass through <font color='Salmon'>a given ecosystem, and with the rates</font> at which they do so `解释`.

```
细节: 能量转换 -> 循环 | 转换 | 积累
```

??? quote "translation"
    随着"顶峰", "生物群落", "超级生物" 和各种其他技术术语对于动植物的联系, 在一个特定的地区被批判, 术语 "生态系统" 越来越宽泛地适应有联系的生物与有他们环境的物理因素的整个系统.
    
    最终, 这个系统的能量转换角色被强调. 生态系统因此包含能量的循环, 转换和积累, 并且物质通过居住的事情和他们的活动中间. 生态学家主要关心物质和能量的数量, 这个能量通过一个特定的生态系统和速率, 在这个速率下他们这样做.

### 预判: 讲能量转换
## Part 7 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
==**<font color='Blue'>Alhough 让步转折</font> the ecosystem concept was <font color='hotpink'>very popular 程度</font> in the 1950s and 1960s, it is <font color='Salmon'>no longer</font> the dominant paradigm `主旨`.**==

```
段落主旨: 曾经盛行 -> 不再是主要模型
```

Gleason's arguments against climax and biome are largely valid against ecosystems as well `描述`. <font color='Blue'>Furthermore 进一步</font>, <font color='Salmon'>the number of interactions</font> is <font color='hotpink'>**so great 程度**</font> that they are <font color='Salmon'>difficult to analyze</font>, even with the help of large computers `进一步解释`. <font color='Blue'>Finally 结论</font>, younger ecologists have found ecological <font color='Salmon'>problems involving behavior and life-history adaptations</font> <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> attractive than measuring physical constants `结论`. <font color='Blue'>Nevertheless 句间转折</font>, one still speaks of the ecosystem when referring to a local association of animals and plants, <font color='hotpink'>**usually 程度**</font> <font color='Salmon'>without</font> paying much attention to the energy aspects.


```
细节: 顶峰和生物群系论点被反对 | 难分析 | (行为和生命历史)的适应性
```

??? quote "translation"
    尽管生态系统概念在1950到1660年代非常盛行, 但是它不再是主要的模型. 
    
    G 反对顶峰和生物群系的论点同样非常有效地反对生态系统. 此外, 一定数量的交互作用非常重要, 他们很难去分析, 甚至在大计算机的帮助下. 最终, 年轻的生态学家发现包括行为和生命历史的适应性的生态问题更加具有吸引力, 相比测量的物理常数. 然而, 一个生态系统的坚持的说法, 当设计局部的动植物联盟时, 通常没有付出太多关注在能量方面.

> Paragraph 4: For Clements, the climax was a "superorganism," an organic entity. Even some authors who accepted the climax concept rejected Clements' characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is indeed a misleading metaphor. An ant colony may be legitimately called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the colony always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances. But there is no evidence for such an interacting communicative network in a climax plant formation. Many authors prefer the term "association" to the term "community" in order to stress the looseness of the interaction.
