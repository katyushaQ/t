    > 术语”化石“ 常常暗示化石，根据字面意思一个到石头的转变。

    <font color='Salmon'>After</font> the death of an organism, the soft tissue is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and bacteria.
    > 在一个有机物死后，软组织普遍低被食腐动物和细菌所消耗。

    The empty shell of a snail or clam may be left behind, and if it is sufficiently durable and resistant to dissolution, it may remain basically unchanged for a long period of time.
    > 蜗牛和蛤蜊的空壳在这之后可能会留下，如果它足够的持久，并且对抗溶解，它可能保留下基础的未改变的，在很长的一段时期内。

    Indeed, unaltered shells of marine invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old.
    > 确实，未改变的海洋无脊椎动物的壳，被了解到来自超过100万年的沉淀物。

    In many marine creatures, <font color='Blue'>however 句内转折</font>, the skeleton is composed of a mineral variety of calcium carbonate`碳酸钙` called aragonite`霰石`.
    > 然而，在许多海洋生物中，骨骼是由一个各种碳酸钙组成的被称作霰石矿物质。
    
    <font color='Blue'>Although 让步转折</font> aragonite has the same composition as the <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> familiar mineral known as calcite, it has a different crystal form, is relatively unstable, and in time`及时，适时` changes to the <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> stable calcite.
    > 尽管霰石有同样的组织，与更熟悉的我们知道的方解石矿物质一样，它有不同的水晶形式，它相对是不稳定的，并且适时改变为更稳定的方解石。

### 预判：详细阐述 壳和矿物质骨骼到化石的转变过程
## Part 3 —— 阐述沉淀式矿化过程 —— 顺承Part2
==**<font color='hotpink'>Many other</font> processes may alter the shell of a clam or snail and enhance its chances for preservation.`主旨`**==

## Part 4 —— 阐述同步交换式矿化过程 —— 顺承Part3
==**Petrifaction may <font color='hotpink'>also</font> involve a simultaneous exchange of the original substance of a dead plant or animal with mineral matter of a different composition. **==

段落主旨：同步交换式矿化过程
ALSO 也，第二种过程
提出术语：代替
```

<span style="background: #D9FFFF">
This process is termed " replacement" <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> solutions have dissolved the original material and replaced it with an equal volume of the new substance. `顺承，解释` Replacement can be a marvelously precise process, so that details of shell ornamentation, tree rings in wood, and delicate structures in bone are accurately preserved. `顺承，举例`

    > 化石可能也包含，有不同组成部分的矿物质的，死了的动植物的最初的物质的同步交换。

    This process is termed "replacement" <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> solutions`溶液` have dissolved the original material and replaced it with an equal volume`量` of the new substance.
    > 这个过程的术语是“代替”，因为溶液已经溶解了原始材料，并且用一个新物质的等价的量代替它。

    Replacement can be a marvelously`奇迹般的，极好的` precise process, so that details of shell ornamentation`装饰，纹饰`, tree rings in wood, and delicate`精致的，脆弱的` structures in bone are accurately preserved.
    > 代替会是一个极好的精准的过程，因此壳的纹饰，木头的年轮，和骨头里脆弱的结构的细节被准确的保留下来。

### 预判：继续阐述 另一种壳矿化过程
## Part 5 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
==**<font color='hotpink'>Another type</font> of fossilization, known as carbonization, occurs when soft tissues are preserved as thin films of carbon. **==

Leaves and tissue of soft-bodied organisms such as jellyfish or worms may accumulate, become buried and compressed, and lose their volatile constituents. The carbon often remains behind as a blackened silhouette.

### 预判：
## Part 6 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Al<font color='Blue'>though 让步转折</font> it is certainly true that the possession of hard parts enhances the prospect of preservation, organisms having soft tissues and organs are also occasionally preserved. Insects and even small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees. X-ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles, digestive tracts, and visual organs of a variety of marine creatures. Soft parts, including skin, hair, and viscera of ice age mammoths, have been preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil seeps.

## Part 7 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
The probability that actual remains of soft tissue will be preserved is improved if the organism dies in an environment of rapid deposition and oxygen deprivation. Under such conditions, the destructive effects of bacteria are diminished. The Middle Eocene Messel Shale (from about 48 million years ago) of Germany accumulated in such an environment. The shale was deposited in an oxygen-deficient lake where lethal gases sometimes bubbled up and killed animals. Their remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and were then covered by clay and silt. Among the superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with iridescent exoskeletons (hard outer coverings), frogs with skin and blood vessels intact, and even entire small mammals with preserved fur and soft tissue.
