    在冬天, 一个城市产生的热量能等于或者超过从太阳获得的热量总和. 
    
    所有供暖大厦的热量最终转化到环境空气中, 一个最快的过程, 在房子被隔离非常不好的情况下. 但是在冬天, 一辆汽车产生足够的热量可以温暖一个普通的房子, 并且如果一个房子有非常好的隔离, 一个成年人也能产生比足够的热量更多的热量来温暖房子. 因此, 甚至没有任何工业的热量, 一个城市地区倾向于比周围的乡村更暖和.

```
段落主旨: 两个因素 -> 导致全面升温
```

<font color='Salmon'>The first</font> is <font color='Salmon'>the heat capacity of the materials</font> that constitute the city, which is typically dominated by concrete and asphalt. <font color='Salmon'>During</font> the day, heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored—to be released at night. <font color='Blue'>But 句间转折</font> in the countryside materials have a significantly lower heat capacity <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> a vegetative blanket prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground. 

```
因素1: 城市建造材料
污染: 白天存储 晚上释放
对比: 乡村热量低, 原因 -> 植物多
```

<font color='Salmon'>The second</font> factor is that <font color='Salmon'>radiant heat coming into the city from the Sun</font> is trapped in <font color='Salmon'>two ways</font>: (1) by <font color='Salmon'>a continuing series of reflection among the numerous vertical surfaces</font> that buildings present and (2) by <font color='Salmon'>the dust dome</font>, the cloudlike layer of polluted air that most cities produce. Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through the pollution dome <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> easily than outgoing longwave radiation does; <font color='Salmon'>the latter is absorbed by the gaseous pollutants of the dome and reradiated back to the urban surface</font>. 

```
因素2: 太阳辐射
两种方式: 大楼建持续性反射 | 受污染的尘埃圆顶
对比: 短波 > 长波 (穿透力) -> 长波被留下 -> 进行再辐射
```

??? quote "translation"
    染料的燃烧, 如由汽车产生的, 不是这个增长热量的唯一来源. 两个其他因素促成更高的全部的城市温度. 
    
    第一因素是建造城市的材料的热量, 它通常由水泥和沥青支配. 在一天中, 来自太阳的热量能被实施到哲学材料中并存储下来 - 在晚上被释放出来. 但是在乡村, 材料有显著地低热量, 因为植物的覆盖阻挡热量很容易的流入或流出地下.
    
    第二个因素是来自太阳进入城市辐射热量处于两种方式中: (1) 来自不间断的连续的反射在许多大厦呈现的垂直表面之间, (2) 来自尘埃圆顶, 云雾状的大多数城市产生的受空气污染的层. 来自太阳的短波辐射比向外的长波辐射更容易穿过污染圆顶; 后者(长波)由圆顶的气态污染物所吸收, 然后再辐射回城市表面.

## Part 4 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island.

The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat-island intensity for that region. In general, the larger the city, the greater its heat-island intensity. The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout, population density, and productive activities of a metropolis.

## Part 5 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
The surface-atmosphere relationships inside metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic peculiarities. For one thing, the presence or absence of moisture is affected by the special qualities of the urban surface. With much of the built-up landscape impenetrable by water, even gentle rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and parking lots. Thus, city surfaces, as well as the air above them, tend to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation, relative humidities are usually lower. Wind movements are also modified in cities <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> buildings increase the friction on air flowing around them. This friction tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far <font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> efficient at dispersing pollutants. On the other hand, air turbulence increases <font color='Blue'>because 因果</font> of the effect of skyscrapers on airflow. Rainfall is also increased in cities. The cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the built-up surface.

> Paragraph 2: In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building eventually transfers to the surrounding air, a process that is quickest where houses are poorly insulated. But an automobile produces enough heat to warm an average house in winter, and if a house were perfectly insulated, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. Therefore, even without any industrial production of heat, an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.

> Paragraph 4: Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island. Heat islands develop best under particular conditions associated with light winds, but they can form almost any time. The precise configuration of a heat island depends on several factors. For example, the wind can make a heat island stretch in the direction it blows. When a heat island is well developed, variations can be extreme; in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7℃ warmer than the side streets. Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic instead of moving. The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat-island intensity for that region. In general, the larger the city, the greater its heat-island intensity. The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout, population density, and productive activities of a metropolis.

    13. Look at the four squares [■] that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.
    
    Another possibility is for the heat island to be stretched along the course of major rivers, since large waterways typically have a warming effect on the air directly above them.  

    Where would the sentence best fit?
