    当许多不同种类的相同种类的若干个体依赖同一个有限资源的时候, 一个情况会升高, 涉及到竞争. 
    
    竞争的存在很早就被自然学家所了解; 竞争的影响被 D 描述的相当详细. 在相同种类(品种内的竞争)之中的竞争, 一个主要的自然选择机制, 是进化的生物学所关心的事. 在不同种类(品种间的竞争)之中的竞争, 是一个生态学主要关心的事. 
    
    它是控制竞争数量大小的一个因素, 并且极端的情况会导致一个竞争种类的灭绝. 这个由 D 说明,  对于新西兰本地动物和植物的种类, 它们是当欧洲引进的竞争种类而灭绝的种类.

??? quote "sentence"

    不严重的竞争存在于, 当主要需要的资源过多的供应的时候, 如大多数共存的食草动物(吃植物的动物). 
    
    此外, 多数种类不完全依赖单一的资源, 如果主要资源对于一个种类变得稀缺, 这个种类通常会换到另一个资源. 如果比一个种类更多的种类正在争夺一个稀缺资源, 这个竞争种类通常转换到不同的另一个资源去. 
    
    竞争通常与在环境上有相似要求的之间有很严重的紧密的联系. 但是它也会发生在对于竞争相同资源完全没有联系的形式, 如吃种子的啮齿动物和蚂蚁. 这些竞争的影响生动形象地证明, 所有动植物在生态系统中发展到竞争的时间, 如发生在200百万年上新世末, 当北美和南美由巴拿马地峡连接的时候. 北美和南美的种类移居贯穿巴拿马地峡, 现在发展到互相竞争. 结果是南美哺乳动物大部分的灭绝, 这些动物明显不能抵抗来自北美种类入侵的竞争--尽管增加的捕食也是一种重要因素.

## Part 3 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
To what extent competition determines the composition of a community and the density of particular species has been the source of considerable controversy. The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the spread or increase of one species and the concurrent reduction or disappearance of another species. The Russian biologist G. F. Gause performed numerous tow-species experiments in the laboratory, in which one of the species became extinct when <font color='hotpink'>**only 极端词**</font> a single kind of resource was available. On the basis of these experiments and of field observations, the so-called law of competitive exclusion was formulated, according to which no two species can occupy the same niche. Numerous seeming exceptions to this law have since been found, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> they can usually be explained as cases in which the two species, even <font color='Blue'>though 让步转折</font> competing for a major joint resource, did not really occupy exactly the same niche.

## Part 4 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Competition among species is of considerable evolutionary importance. The physical structure of species competing for resources in the same ecological niche tends to gradually evolve in ways that allow them to occupy different niches. Competing species also tend to change their ranges so that their territories no longer overlap. The evolutionary effect of competition on species has been referred to as “species selection”; however, this description is potentially misleading. <font color='hotpink'>**Only 极端词**</font> the individuals of a species are subject to the pressures of natural selection. The effect on the well-being and existence of a species is just the result of the effects of selection on all the individuals of the species. Thus species selection is actually a result of individual selection.

Competition may occur for any needed resource. In the case of animals it is usually food; in the case of forest plants it may be light; in the case of substrate inhabitants it may be space, as in many shallow-water bottom-dwelling marine organisms. Indeed, it may be for any of the factors, physical as well as biotic, that are essential for organisms. Competition is usually the <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> severe the denser the population. Together with predation, it is <font color='hotpink'>**the most 最高级**</font> important density-dependent factor in regulating population growth.

A. Apparent exceptions to this law usually involves cases in which two species compete for the same major resource but occupy slightly different niches.

B. Although it may appear that two species always have different niches, many exceptions show that species compete with each other.

C. Cases in which two species not only compete for a shared resource but also occupy similar niches are considered exceptions to this law.

According to paragraph 4, “species selection”is a misleading term because it
A. overemphasizes the role of selection pressure in species extinction

B. suggests that selection pressures directly influence whole species

【Directions】An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below. Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage. This question is worth 2 points. When necessary resources are limited, competition can occur among individuals of the same species or of different species.
A.Competition can eliminate a species, but since most species do not depend on a single resource, competition is often reduced by switching to alternative resources.

B.Competition between individuals of the same species is usually for food whereas competition between species is usually for habitat.

C.Investigation of the ecological role of competition is difficult because ordinarily the competition cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from its presumed effects.

D.Experiments and field observations have established that competition between species is strong enough to prevent two species from occupying the same ecologica niche.

E.Competition between a pair of species tends to lessen over time because the species tend to evolve to occupy different ecological niches and ranges.

F.Competition is usually strongest when the density of the competing populations is the same.
