<h3>Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer   4/14</h3>

<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（主旨：引出Ogallala aquifer）*</font>The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers <font color='Blue'>in the 1880s</font>. This region has a semiarid climate, and for 50 years after its settlement, it supported a low-intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（顺承递进）*</font> <font color='red'>**||**</font> <font color='Blue'>In the early twentieth century</font>, however, it was discovered (that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge aquifer) (a rock layer containing large quantities of groundwater). This aquifer was named the Ogallala aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, (who once inhabited the region).<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（顺承递进，用地区阐述Ogallala aquifer的出处）*</font>

<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（主旨：Ogallala aquifer的形成元素导致评估与实际有差异）*</font>The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone formation (that underlies some 583,000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota). <font color='red'>**||**</font> Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（细节：水的来源）*</font> Estimates indicate (that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron), <font color='Blue'>but unfortunately</font>, under the semiarid climatic conditions (that presently exist in the region), rates of <font color='Salmon'>addition to</font> the aquifer are minimal, <font color='Salmon'>amounting to</font> about half a centimeter a year.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（细节：评估与实际情况差异）*</font>

The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of <font color='Blue'>the early 1930s</font>.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（细节1：提出第一口井）*</font> The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, <font color='Blue'>especially from the 1950s onward</font>, transformed the economy of the region.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（细节2：提出灌溉发展）*</font> More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（顺承递进1-2细节的联系：灌溉发展，井多）*</font> <font color='red'>**||**</font> Modern irrigation devices, each capable of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape (dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops). <font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（细节3：设备浇灌能力做铺垫）*</font>Ogallala water <font color='Salmon'>has enabled</font> the High Plains region <font color='Salmon'>to</font> supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. <font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（细节4：Ogallala water能支持细节3的需求）*</font>In addition, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are fattened here.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（补充说明）*</font>

This unprecedented development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate—(that is, virtually no natural water source to replenish the water supply)—has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically. <font color='red'>**||**</font> <font color='Blue'>In the 1930s</font>, wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters; <font color='Blue'>currently</font>, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. <font color='Salmon'>In places</font>, <font color='hotpink'>**the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year, (necessitating) the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps.**</font><font color='red'>（问题：deepening这个ing形式没看懂是什么成分——the periodic deepening是一个名词成分，A of B）</font> <font color='hotpink'>**It is estimated (that at current withdrawal rates, much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years）.**</font><font color='red'>（问题：这句是强调句么？——不是！是It形式主语，that后面到结尾都是从句内容）</font>The situation is most critical in Texas, (where the climate is driest), <font color='Salmon'>the greatest amount of </font>water is being pumped, and the aquifer contains the least water. It is projected (that the remaining Ogallala water will), <font color='Blue'>by the year 2030,</font> support <font color='Blue'>only 35 to 40 percent</font> of the irrigated acreage in Texas (<font color='Blue'>that is supported in 1980</font>).<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（顺承递进，举例支持）*</font>

<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（主旨：农民对Ogallala不同的必然损耗的不同反应）*</font>The reaction of farmers to the inevitable depletion of the Ogallala varies. <font color='Blue'>Many</font> have been <font color='Salmon'>attempting to</font> conserve water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops (that require less water). <font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（顺承递进：举例说明1）*</font><font color='Blue'>Others</font>, however, <font color='hotpink'>**have adopted the philosophy (that it is best to use the water (while it is still economically profitable to do so) and to concentrate on high-value crops such as cotton).**</font><font color='red'>（问题：to do so => best to use?）</font><font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（顺承递进：举例说明2）*</font><font color='hotpink'>**The incentive of the farmers (who <font color='Salmon'>wish to</font> conserve water) is reduced by their knowledge (that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water, and in the process are <font color='Salmon'>drawing down</font> the entire region's water supplies).**</font><font color='red'>（问题1：and与谁并列，and应该是定从中的并列对吧， are profiting和are drawing down；问题2：没看懂这句与前面的句间关系，怎么有种转折的意思？意思开始农民们想省水，结果由于邻居的过度浪费，减少了省水的动力？）</font>

<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（主旨：水资源危机，方案，结论）*</font><font color='Salmon'>In the face of</font> the upcoming water supply crisis, <font color='Salmon'>a number of</font> grandiose schemes have been developed to transport vast quantities of water by canal or pipeline from the Mississippi, the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（提出解决方案）*</font> <font color='red'>**||**</font> <font color='Blue'>Unfortunately</font>, <font color='hotpink'>**the cost of water (obtained through any of these schemes) would increase pumping costs <font color='Salmon'>at least </font>tenfold, making the cost of irrigated agricultural products from the region uncompetitive on the national and international markets.**</font><font color='red'>（问题：making是与前面的pumping并列么？——不是并列，SVO，doing做结果状语——自己去看长难句！！！）</font> <font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（转折：成本问题）*</font> <font color='red'>**||**</font> Somewhat more promising have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting (compressed) air into the ground. <font color='Blue'>Even if</font> this process proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution, as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. <font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（转折：新品种研发）*</font> <font color='red'>**||**</font> Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is evident (that within the High Plains), irrigation water will never again be the abundant, inexpensive resource it was during the agricultural boom years of the mid-twentieth century.<font color='LightSeaGreen'>*（结论：不论什么方案，水资源危机都会到来）*</font>
