## 文章结构思路：X一个东西 
## Part 1 —— 介绍 runoff channels [下定义和怎么来的]
<span style="background: #D9FFFF">
Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water <font color='Salmon'>once</font> existed <font color='hotpink'>in great quantity</font> on the surface of Mars `铺垫`.

主旨: 两个水流类型 runoff channels | outflow channels
```

<span style="background: #DDDDFF">
<font color='Salmon'>Runoff channels</font> are found in the <font color='Salmon'>southern highlands</font> `细节, 位置介绍`. These flow features are <font color='Salmon'>extensive systems</font>—sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length—of interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to merge into larger, wider channels `细节, 描述`. They bear a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are <font color='Salmon'>dried 早就已经干涸了</font>-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys `细节, 参考地球进一步描述`. Runoff channels on Mars speak of <font color='Salmon'>a time 4 billion years ago</font> (the age of the Martian highlands), when the <font color='Salmon'>atmosphere was thicker, the surface warmer, and liquid water widespread</font> `时间和特征描述`.

    图片证据表名, 液体水曾经大量存在于火星表面. 两种水流特征被看到: 径流河道和流出河道. 径流河道在南部高地被发现. 这些水流是广泛的相互连接的, 看起来合并到更大的更宽的曲折的河道的系统 -- 有时总长上百千米. 他们具有一个很强的相似之处与地球的河流系统, 并且地质学家认为他们已经干涸了 -- 长的河床显示出来 -- 河流已经消失, 这些河流是曾经承载了火星上的从山上到峡谷的降雨的河流. 在大气层更厚, 表面更暖, 并且液体水遍布广泛的时候, 径流河道在火星上表明为一个4亿年前的时间 (火山高地的年龄).

### 预判: 2个类型的另一个, 描述outflow channels
## Part 2 —— 介绍 outflow channels [下定义和怎么来的] —— 顺承Part2
<span style="background: #D9FFFF">
Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago `介绍`.

The onrushing water arising from these flash floods <font color='Blue'> likely also 进一步</font> formed the odd teardrop-shaped “islands” (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains <font color='Salmon'>close to the ends of the outflow channels</font>`细节, 描述形成, 特征, 位置`. Judging from <font color='Salmon'>the width and depth</font> of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous—perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon river `细节, 数据参照解释`. Flooding shaped the outflow channels <font color='hotpink'>**approximately 程度**</font> 3 billion years ago, about <font color='Salmon'>the same times</font> as the northern volcanic plains formed `描述, 形成时间`.

    在很久以前的火星, 流出河道可能是灾难性的洪水的残余. 他们只出现在酷热的地区, 通常形成不了广泛的相互连接的网络. 相反, 他们可能是道路, 有大量的从南部高地流出的进入北方平原的水. 从这些突发的洪水上升的汹涌的水也可能形成奇怪的泪珠形状的 "岛屿" (类似微型的版本看起来在低潮汐的, 我们的海滩的湿的沙子里), 这个岛屿在接近流出河道的末端的平原被发现. 根据通道的宽度和深度来判断, 这个水流率必须是巨大的, 可能比大亚马逊河每秒承载的105吨大100倍. 水灾形成流出河道接近3亿年以前, 大约在同一个时间, 北部火山平原也形成了.

### 预判: 为什么会是这样
## Part 3 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period <font color='Salmon'>during</font> which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta—a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands. Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north polar region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin’s rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea.

These ideas remain controversial.

## Part 5 —— —— 顺承/并列Part
Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are inconclusive, astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny. Yet even setting aside the unproven hints of ancient oceans, the extent of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that virtually all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost layer under the surface, with <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> contained in the planet’s polar caps.

##### 13. 文章小结

Directions: An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below. Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage. This question is worth 2 points. There is much debate concerning whether Mars once had water.
A.Mars’ runoff and outflow channels are large-scale, distinctive features that suggest that large quantities of liquid water once flowed on Mars.

B.Although some researchers claim that Mars may once have had oceans, others dispute this, pointing to an absence of evidence or offering alternative interpretations of evidence.

C.Various types of images have been used to demonstrate that most of Martian surface contains evidence of flowing water.

D.The runoff and outflow channels of Mars apparently carried a higher volume of water and formed more extensive networks than do Earth’s river systems.

E.There is very little evidence of liquid water on Mars today, and it is assumed that all the water that once existed on the planet is frozen beneath its surface.

F.While numerous gullies have been discovered on Mars since 2000, many astronomers dismiss them as evidence that Mars once had liquid water.
