    ■ Within fifty years, the government in Baghdad was using paper for documents.

    ■ Writing in ink on paper, unlike parchment, could not easily be erased, and <font color='Blue'>therefore 因果</font> paper had the advantage that it was difficult to alter what was written on it.

The introduction of paper spurred a conceptual revolution whose consequences have barely been explored. Although paper was never as cheap as it has become today, it was far <font color='hotpink'>**less 比较词**</font> expensive than parchment, and <font color='Blue'>therefore 因果</font> <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> people could afford to buy books, Paper is thinner than parchment, so <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> pages could be enclosed within a single volume. At first, paper was made in relatively small sheets that were pasted together, <font color='Blue'>but 句内转折</font> by the beginning of the fourteenth century, very large sheets – as much as a meter across – were available. These large sheets meant that calligraphers and artists had <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> space on which to work. Paintings became <font color='hotpink'>**more 比较词**</font> complicated, giving the artist greater opportunities to depict space or emotion. The increased availability of paper, particularly <font color='Salmon'>after</font> 1250, encouraged people to develop systems of representation, such as architectural plans and drawings. This in turn allowed the easy transfer of artistic ideas and motifs over great distances from one medium to another, and in a different scale in ways that had been difficult, if not impossible, in the previous period.

Rounded styles of Arabic handwriting had long been used for correspondence and documents <font color='Salmon'>alongside</font> the formal angular scripts used for inscriptions and manuscripts of the Koran. Around the year 900, Ibn Muqla, who was a secretary and vizier at the Abbasid court in Baghdad, developed a system of proportioned writing. He standardized the length of alif, <font color='hotpink'>**the first 最高级**</font> letter of the Arabic alphabet, and then determined what the size and shape of all other letters should be, based on the alif. Eventually, six round forms of handwriting, composed of three pairs of big and little scripts known collectively as the Six Pens, became the standard repertory of every calligrapher.
