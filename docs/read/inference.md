Paragraph 2: Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence, successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature, but in fact they tend to be relatively short-lived in geological terms. 

As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more recently it was formed; for example, the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old. 

Lower mountains tend to be older, and are often the eroded relics of much higher mountain chains. About 400 million years ago, when the present-day continents of North America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian mountain chain was the same size as the modern Himalayas. 

Today, however, the relics of the Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period) exist as the comparatively low mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United States, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal plateau.

Paragraph 10: The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process. 

Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form. 

In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.

Paragraph 1: Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling all the available spaces. 

By far the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle. 

Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from precipitation (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. 

There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. 

At first thought it seems incredible that there can be enough space in the “solid” ground underfoot to hold all this water.

Paragraph 1: The transition from forest to treeless tundra on a mountain slope is often a dramatic one. 

Within a vertical distance of just a few tens of meters, trees disappear as a life-form and are replaced by low shrubs, herbs, and grasses. 

This rapid zone of transition is called the upper timberline or tree line. 

In many semiarid areas there is also a lower timberline where the forest passes into steppe or desert at its lower edge, usually because of a lack of moisture.

Paragraph 2: Nearly any kind of plant of the forest understory can be part of a deer's diet. Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow plants, the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other shrub or herb. 

But this is fair-weather feeding. 

What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy? 

One compensation for not hibernating is the built-in urge to migrate. 

Deer may move from high-elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall. 

Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other arboreal fodder.

Paragraph 2： One of the most puzzling aspects of the paintings is their location. 

Other rock paintings—for example, those of Bushmen in South Africa—are either located near cave entrances or completely in the open. 

Cave paintings in France and Spain, however, are in recesses and caverns far removed from original cave entrances. 

This means that artists were forced to work in cramped spaces and without sources of natural light. 

It also implies that whoever made them did not want them to be easily found. 

Since cave dwellers normally lived close to entrances, there must have been some reason why so many generations of Lascaux cave dwellers hid their art.

Paragraph 4: Wind power is most economical in areas with steady winds. 

In areas where the wind dies down, backup electricity from a utility company or from an energy storage system becomes necessary. 

Backup power could also be provided by linking wind farms with a solar cell, with conventional or pumped-storage hydropower, or with efficient natural-gas-burning turbines. 

Some drawbacks to wind farms include visual pollution and noise, although these can be overcome by improving their design and locating them in isolated areas.

Paragraph 3: The body that impacted Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period was a meteorite with a mass of more than a trillion tons and a diameter of at least 10 kilometers. 

Scientists first identified this impact in 1980 from the worldwide layer of sediment deposited from the dust cloud that enveloped the planet after the impact. 

This sediment layer is enriched in the rare metal iridium and other elements that are relatively abundant in a meteorite but very rare in the crust of Earth. 

Even diluted by the terrestrial material excavated from the crater, this component of meteorites is easily identified. 

By 1990 geologists had located the impact site itself in the Yucat region of Mexico. 

The crater, now deeply buried in sediment, was originally about 200 kilometers in diameter.

Paragraph 3: Certainly, in trying to explain the Roman phenomenon, one would have to place great emphasis on this almost instinct for the territorial imperative. 

Roman priorities lay in the organization, exploitation, and defense of their territory. 

In all probability it was the fertile plain of Latium, where the Latins who founded Rome originated, that created the habits and skills of landed settlement, landed property, landed economy, landed administration, and a land-based society. 

From this arose the Roman genius for military organization and orderly government. 

In turn, a deep attachment to the land, and to the stability which rural life engenders, fostered the Roman virtues: gravitas, a sense of responsibility, peitas, a sense of devotion to family and country, and iustitia, a sense of the natural order.

Paragraph 1：In order to understand ancient Egyptian art, it is vital to know as much as possible of the elite Egyptians' view of the world and the functions and contexts of the art produced for them. 

Without this knowledge we can appreciate only the formal content of Egyptian art, and we will fail to understand why it was produced or the concepts that shaped it and caused it to adopt its distinctive forms. 

In fact, a lack of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be compared unfavorably with the art of other cultures: Why did the Egyptians not develop sculpture in which the body turned and twisted through space like classical Greek statuary?

Why do the artists seem to get left and right confused? 

And why did they not discover the geometric perspective as European artists did in the Renaissance? 

The answer to such questions has nothing to do with a lack of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists and everything to do with the purposes for which they were producing their art.

Paragraph 2：Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees. 

The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do their tree-nesting relatives. 

These higher-frequency sounds do not travel as far, and so may better conceal the individuals producing them, who are especially vulnerable to predators in their ground nests. 

David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. 

The eggs “advertised” by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten significantly more often than the eggs associated with the ground-nesters' calls.
