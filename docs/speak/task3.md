    ==**Reading**==
    
    The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. （大学决定对学生们停止免费公交服务。）
    
    The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses arc expensive to operate. （这个决定的原因是只有少部分学生乘坐公交并且公交使用费用昂贵。）
    
    Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. （当前，这个公交从校园中间出发途径教学楼和一些邻近校园的社区。）
    
     The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots. （通过消除公交服务节省下来的钱可以用来大量扩张过度拥挤的学生公园。）
    
     ==**Listening**==
    
     Man:I don't like the university's plan. （我不喜欢学校的计划）
    
     Woman:Really? I've ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste.（真的？我坐过那些公交，并且有时只有几个人在车上。这个看起来是各种浪费。）
    
    Man:I see your point. （我明白你的意思。）But I think the problem is the route's out-of-date.（但是我认为路线更新是一个问题） It only goes through the neighborhoods 【that've gotten too expensive for students to live in】. （它只经过由于太贵而学生无法入住的社区。）It's ridiculous that they haven't already changed the route - you know, so it goes where most of campus students live now.（可笑的是他们并没有改变路线——你知道，所以这个路线是现在大多数校园学生居住的地方。） I bet if they did that, they'd get plenty of students riding those buses.（我敢肯定，会有很多学生坐那些公交。）
    
     Woman:Well, at least they are adding more parking. It's gotten really tough to find a space.（至少可以增加公园面积。找到一块空地确实很困难。）
    
     Man:That's the other part I don't like, actually. （实际上，那是我不喜欢的另一个方面。）Cutting back the bus service and adding parking's just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus.（削减公交服务和增加公园面积只会激发更多的学生在校园里开车） And that'll just add to the noise around campus and create more traffic...and that'll increase the need for more parking spaces.（并且这只会在校园周围增加噪音和制造更多的交通事故。。。并且这将更加增加对公园空地的需求。）
    
     Woman:Yeah, I guess I can see your point. （是的，我想我明白你的意思。）Maybe it would be better if more students used the buses instead of driving.（也许更多的学生使用公交替代开车看来了更好。）

    Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.（学生们将同样受益于另一种方式，因为有限制的早餐选择为冷早餐可以节省钱并能使我们保持我们的餐供应计划。）

For example on cold mornings students will need hot food like hot cereal more than cold food like yogurt. Secondly she argues that the students will go off-campus to pay more prices to get what they want due to the cutting back of meals. As a result the cost will actually add up and is therefore a worse situation for the students. All in all, the woman disagrees with the announcement for the reasons stated above.`

    It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all students in computer classes.  （这个改变希望减少这些数量的学生注册日间课并且因此保证所有学生在计算机课上有个人的计算机使用权。）

    (man) No, actually, I don't think it's a good idea.（不，实际上，我认为这不是一个好主意。）
    
    (woman) Why not?（为什么不？）
    
    (man) Well, like the part about how it'll help students concentrate, I mean, maybe a little snack will help the person who's eating it, but, the trouble is that it makes it hard for everyone else to concentrate cause they have to listen to someone munching on chips, or biting into an apple, or crinkling paper wrappers.（像如何帮助学生专注这块，我的意思，也许没有小吃能帮吃的人，但是，麻烦是它使得其他的每个人难以专注，导致他们必须去听一些人出声的嚼薯条，咬苹果，或者揉纸袋。）
    
    (woman) I guess it can be kind of disruptive.（我觉得它是一直扰乱性的。）
    
    (man) Yeah! It will interfere with everyone's concentration. You wouldn't be able to pay attention with all the noises going on.（是的。它会干扰每个人的注意力。你不能在一直有噪音的情况下专心做事。）
    
    (woman) OK, I guess I will have to agree with you on that, but what about her other reason? （好的，我觉得我不能不同意你的看法，但是她的另一个原因呢？）

    It would be nice to be able to have some fun at the end of the semester, right? （那个能在期末有一些乐趣，是不是？）

    (man) No, there's a problem with that, too.（不，那个也有问题。）
    
    (woman) Why?（为什么？）
    
    (man) Well, I don’t think it’s appropriate to use class time for that kind of thing. （我认为对于这种事使用课堂时间是不合适的。）
    
    I mean, the last class is usually pretty important, that’s when we do a lot of reviewing for final exams.（我的意思，最后一课通常是相当重要的，那时我们要做为期末考试做大量的复习。）
    
    (woman) True!（确实！）
    
    (man) If we use that time for that, we probably wouldn't have time to do as much reviewing, which means we wouldn't be as well prepared for exams.（如果我们使用这个时间做那个，我们也许没有足够的复习时间，意思是我们不能很好的准备考试。）
    
    (woman) Yeah, I haven’t thought of that.（是的，我无法想象。）
    
    ==**Speak**==
    
    `A STUDENT DISAGREES WITH THAT the university prohibit students eating in classroom. BECAUSE students often hungry during long class. AND they can have a party with snack foods and beverages to celebrate the end of semester. IN THE CONVERSATION, THE MAN DISAGREES WITH THIS. FIRST OF ALL, it will interfere with everyone's concentrate. Peoples wouldn't be able to pay attention with all the noises going on. The trouble is that it make it hard of everyone else to concentrate cause they have to listen to someone munching on chips, or biting into an apple, or crinkling paper wrappers. SECOND, it's appropriate to use class time for that kind of thing. Because the last class is usually pretty important, if they use that time for that, they probably wouldn't have time to do so much reviewing  for final exams.`

??? info "**TPO 15 University Should Pave Running Trails（学校要铺设跑步小路）**"

    ==**Reading**==
    
    The university has about three miles of unpaved dirt running trails that pass through the forest near campus. （学校有三英里未铺设的土路，这条路在校园附近通向森林。）
    
    I think these trails should be paved with cement. （我认为这些路应该铺设为水泥路面。）
    
    One reason for paving the trails would be to increase their safety. （对于铺路的一个原因是能够增加路面安全。）
    
    When it rains, the dirt turns to mud and becomes very slippery, so the runners who use them can slip and fall. （下雨的时候，那些土会变成泥，并且会变得很滑，所以在这条路上跑步的人们会滑到。）
    
    Pavement would solve this problem. （铺设的路面可以解决这个问题。）
    
    Also, paving would make the trails look nicer, which would encourage students to use them. （同时，铺设可以让这条路看起来更好，它能够鼓励学生们使用。）
    
    Bumps in the trail would be smoothed out and weeds would be paved over, making the trail more attractive to runners.（小路上凸起的部分会被修平，并且野草也会被铲除，使得这条路更加吸引跑步者。）

    
    ==**Listening**==
    
    (woman) Hey, Ted, you're a runner. Did you see this letter in the paper?（Ted，你是跑步者吗？你看到这个信函了吗？）

    (man) Yeah, I did, and I use those.（是的，我是，并且我看到了。）
    
    (woman) And?（然后？）
    
    (man) I think it's a terrible idea.（我认为这是个很糟糕的建议。）
    
    (woman) How come?（怎么？）
    
    (man) Well, she really hasn't thought it through. （她真的没有想过。）
    
    Like, the thing about making them safer, what's she's not thinking about is the long-term consequence of running on a hard surface.（这个事能使他们更安全，她没有想这是一个长期在硬的路面跑步的后果是什么。）
    
    (woman) What do you mean?（你什么意思？）
    
    (man) I mean, it's not good for you. It's too hard on your bones and joints. （我的意思，这事对你不好。对你的骨骼和关节来说太硬。）
    
     you run repeatedly on hard surface, it can lead to injuries or, that's what I've been taught anyway, it's better to run on a soft surface. （你在硬的路面跑圈，路面会导致你受伤或者，至少我被教育过，最好在一个软的平面上跑步。）
     
     It does less damage to your body.（那样对你的身体伤害更小。）
    
    (woman) Oh, I wasn't aware of that.（哦，我没有考虑到这块。）
    
    (man) Yeah, so actually it wouldn't be safer. And her second point…（是的，实际上并不安全。并且第二点……）
    
    (woman) About changing the way they look?（关于他们看到的路面改变？）
    
    (man) Yeah, I don't think people will like it.（是的，我认为人们不会喜欢的。）
    
    (woman) So they'd use them less?（所以他们会更少使用它？）
    
    (man) Yeah, I mean, one of the main reasons people enjoy them now was it’s a way of taking a break from the rest of the campus, from buildings and streets and stuff. （是的，我的意思，一个主要的原因人们享有它现在是一条从大楼和街道之类到校园的休闲小路）
    
    It’s, you know, a chance like you’re out in the nature.（你知道的，一个让你远离进入大自然的机会。）
    
    (woman) Oh, so you wouldn't bet that effect anymore.（所以你能打赌不再会有效果。）
    
    (man) Right! It’d be just like you’re on a regular street or sidewalk. It wouldn't be as relaxing.（是的！你仅在一条普通的街道或者人行道。它不能使人放松。）
    
    ==**Speak**==
    
    `A STUDENT PROPOSES THAT the university should pave about three miles trails which pass through the forest near campus. BECAUSE pavement would increase their safety. MOREOVER it seems better and would encourage students to use. IN THE LISTENING THE MAN DISAGREES WITH THIS. FIRST OF ALL, the pavement with cement is too hard on people's bones and joints. It is can lead to injuries that is the long-term consequence of running on a hard surface, it's better to run on a soft surface. SECOND people wouldn't like about changed way. They enjoy them now it's a way of taking a break from the rest of the campus, from buildings and streets and stuff. This a chance like you're out in the nature.`
