The man gets a problem: he wants to go to the Introduction to Psychology, but he can't find his classroom, because he left his class schedule back at his dorm on the first day of classes. There're two solutions. First, he may go to the Student Center to use the computer which supports to look up and check the room number, but he still can't know where other classes are. Second, he will go into the right building where only has three big lecture halls, checking every floor until he finds it. I recommend he would better go to the lecture hall, checking each hall and asking the professor. Because he doesn't want to be late, and there're elevators that can help him move fast.

    Now listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
    > 听2个学生在校园的对话.
    
    (man) Hi, good morning. Could you help me with something?
    > 嗨, 早上好. 你能帮我个忙么?
    
    (woman) Uh, maybe, what's up?
    > 哦也许, 怎么了?
    
    (man) ==Well==, {++I'm a first-year student++}.
    > ==重点==, 我是一个一年级学生.
    
    (woman) Everything going OK?
    > 每件事都还好?
    
    (man) ==Actually==, {++no++} Um, this is a little embarrassing. {++I think I left my class schedule back at my dorm++}.
    > 实际上, 不. 有点令人尴尬. 我想我把课程表落在宿舍了.
    
    (woman) Hmmm, ==not a good thing to do== {++on the first day of classes++}.
    > 恩, 不是一个好事, 在上课第一天.
    
    (man) ==Yeah==, {++so I'm not sure where my class is++}, {++I think I remember it was supposed to be here in Smith Hall++}.
    > 是的, 所以我不确定我的课在哪儿, 我想我记得据说在这, 在史密斯大厅.
    
    (woman) {++There's a computer for student use in the Student Center. You can go over there, look it up and check the room number++}. ==But== {++you'd have to hurry++}.
    > 学生中心有一个电脑给学生用. 你可以去那, 查一下教师编号. 但是你必须快点.
    
    (man) Hmmm, ==that's not a bad idea==. {++I could check my schedule for the whole rest of the day at the same time. I don't know where any of my other classes are either, but I don't want to be late, make a bad impression with the professor on the first day. It's actually my very first class, Introduction to Psychology++}.
    > 恩, 这不是个坏主意. 我可以查看我的课程, 对于在同一个时间查看我的课程表, 对于一天中的空闲. 我不知道我的其他课程也在哪儿, 但是我不想迟到, 给教授一个不好的印象, 在第一天. 实际上是第一堂课, 心理学导论.
    
    (woman) Psychology? Oh, ==OK==, you’re definitely in the right building. And if it’s Introduction to Psychology, {++it’s gonna be a big class++}. In which case, {++it probably meets in a big lecture hall++}. {++There are only three lecture halls in the building, one on every floor++}. {++Just check each floor till you find yours++}. {++There’s elevators so you should be able to move fast++}.
    > 心理学? 好, 你确定在正确的楼里. 并且如果是心理学导论, 那它会是一个大教室. 在这种情况下, 可能会在一个大的讲座大厅. 那个楼里只有3个讲座大厅, 每层一个. 只需去查看每层直到找到你的教室. 有电梯, 所以你可以更快移动.
    
    (man) Yeah, ==but== {++I don’t know what the professor looks like or anything++}. {++How would I know it’s my class or not? It’d be sort of embarrassing, sticking my head into each lecture hall asking if I was in the right place++}.
    > 是, 但是我不知道教授看起来像什么,或者任何. 我如何直到那是我是不是我的课? 伸头进每个讲座大厅问是否我是在正确的位置, 我觉得有点尴尬.
    
    (woman) ==Well==, {++you might luck out and find it the first time++}."
    > ==重点==, 你也许走运, 并且在第一时间找到.

The woman has a problem: She's struggling between taking the biology exam and accepting an award of the Creative Writing Institute. There're two solutions. First, she will write a five-page paper instead of the examination. Second, she will choose someone else to go in her place and to accept on her behalf. I recommend she would participate in the award ceremony if I were here. For one thing, the professor believed she has lots of ideas and could do a good job. Also, It's better by herself than others, because she will not disappoint her parents and will shake hands with the Institue's president on stage.

    (man) Hey, Marni, what's wrong?
    > 嗨，Marni，怎么了？
    
    (woman) Oh, I'm just struggling`挣扎，斗争` about ==what== to do. {++I won an award from the Creative Writing Institute`学院，协会`++} for a story I wrote and …
    > 哦，我正在纠结应该做什么。我从创意写作协会赢了一个奖，就一个我写的故事来说。
    
    (man) That doesn't sound like anything's wrong.
    > 听起来没什么问题。
    
    (woman) ==Well==, {++it's a huge honor to win`do what深感荣幸` and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I'm so excited about, but, and here's what's frustrating`令人沮丧的`: I've got a Biology exam that's scheduled for the same time++}.
    > 赢了这个深感荣幸，还有一个颁奖典礼，他们邀请我去，我非常激动，但是多么令人沮丧：我得去考生物考试，安排在同一个时间的。
    
    (man) Uh oh, ==well==, {++have you talked to your professor about this++}?
    > 哦，好吧，那你有没有和你的教授谈谈这事儿？
    
    (woman) Yeah, she ==said== {++I could write a five-page paper instead, and I have lots of ideas and know I could do a good job++}, ==but==…
    > 是的，她说我可以写一个5页的论文替代，并且我有很多想法且知道我能做好，但是……
    
    (man) ==But what==?
    > 但是什么？
    
    (woman) ==Well==, {++writing a paper would take up so much time, a lot more than studying for and taking the exam. I have lots of other school work to deal with++}.
    > 厄，写一个论文会占用我太多的时间，比研究和考试占用的时间更多。我有很多其他的学习事情要做。
    
    (man) Oh! ==Or== {++you could have someone else to receive the award for you. I mean, go in your place`代替你去` and accept on your behalf`代表某人`++}.
    > 哦！或者你有其他人能帮你接受这个奖励么。我的意思是，代替你去然后代表你接受。
    
    (woman) ==Maybe==, {++I’ll still get the award and the money that way`钱的方式`++}.
    > 也许，我还会得到奖励和奖金。
    
    (man) Oooh, you won money too?
    > 哦！！你还赢得了奖金？
    
    (woman) Yeah, pretty cool, huh? ==But== any ways, {++my parents were really looking forward to`期待` coming and seeing me on stage shaking hands with the Institute’s president`主席` Knoff. I hate to disappoint them++}.
    > 是的，非常酷，是吧？但是不管怎样，我的父母真的期待来并看到我在台阶上和协会主席Knoff握手。我讨厌让他们失望。
    
    (man) True, I’m sure they are really proud`骄傲的，自豪的`.
    > 是的，他们一定真的很骄傲。
    
    (woman) Like I said, I’m still struggling about what to do.
    > 像我说的，我还是非常纠结做什么。
