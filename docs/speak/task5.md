The woman has a problem: She's struggling between taking the biology exam and accepting an award of the Creative Writing Institute. There're two solutions. First, she will write a five-page paper instead of the examination. Second, she will choose someone else to go in her place and to accept on her behalf. I recommend she would participate in the award ceremony if I were here. For one thing, the professor believed she has lots of ideas and could do a good job. Also, It's better by herself than others, because she will not disappoint her parents and will shake hands with the Institue's president on stage.

    (man) Hey, Marni, what's wrong?
    > 嗨，Marni，怎么了？
    
    (woman) Oh, I'm just struggling`挣扎，斗争` about ==what== to do. {++I won an award from the Creative Writing Institute`学院，协会`++} for a story I wrote and …
    > 哦，我正在纠结应该做什么。我从创意写作协会赢了一个奖，就一个我写的故事来说。
    
    (man) That doesn't sound like anything's wrong.
    > 听起来没什么问题。
    
    (woman) ==Well==, {++it's a huge honor to win`do what深感荣幸` and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I'm so excited about, but, and here's what's frustrating`令人沮丧的`: I've got a Biology exam that's scheduled for the same time++}.
    > 赢了这个深感荣幸，还有一个颁奖典礼，他们邀请我去，我非常激动，但是多么令人沮丧：我得去考生物考试，安排在同一个时间的。
    
    (man) Uh oh, ==well==, {++have you talked to your professor about this++}?
    > 哦，好吧，那你有没有和你的教授谈谈这事儿？
    
    (woman) Yeah, she ==said== {++I could write a five-page paper instead, and I have lots of ideas and know I could do a good job++}, ==but==…
    > 是的，她说我可以写一个5页的论文替代，并且我有很多想法且知道我能做好，但是……
    
    (man) ==But what==?
    > 但是什么？
    
    (woman) ==Well==, {++writing a paper would take up so much time, a lot more than studying for and taking the exam. I have lots of other school work to deal with++}.
    > 厄，写一个论文会占用我太多的时间，比研究和考试占用的时间更多。我有很多其他的学习事情要做。
    
    (man) Oh! ==Or== {++you could have someone else to receive the award for you. I mean, go in your place`代替你去` and accept on your behalf`代表某人`++}.
    > 哦！或者你有其他人能帮你接受这个奖励么。我的意思是，代替你去然后代表你接受。
    
    (woman) ==Maybe==, {++I’ll still get the award and the money that way`钱的方式`++}.
    > 也许，我还会得到奖励和奖金。
    
    (man) Oooh, you won money too?
    > 哦！！你还赢得了奖金？
    
    (woman) Yeah, pretty cool, huh? ==But== any ways, {++my parents were really looking forward to`期待` coming and seeing me on stage shaking hands with the Institute’s president`主席` Knoff. I hate to disappoint them++}.
    > 是的，非常酷，是吧？但是不管怎样，我的父母真的期待来并看到我在台阶上和协会主席Knoff握手。我讨厌让他们失望。
    
    (man) True, I’m sure they are really proud`骄傲的，自豪的`.
    > 是的，他们一定真的很骄傲。
    
    (woman) Like I said, I’m still struggling about what to do.
    > 像我说的，我还是非常纠结做什么。
