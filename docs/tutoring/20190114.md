#### 三：时态填空

1. It (rain){++rains++} every day in August.
2. Last night ,I (eat){++ate++} dinner. Then I (visit){++visited++} some friends ,and later I (write){++wrote++} a couple of letters . 
3. We (have){++had++} a wonderful time when suddenly the electric power went out .
4. When we (look){++looking++} in on our baby last night , he (sleep){++slept++}. I think he (dream){++dreamed++} about something nice because he (smile){++smiling++}.
> When we [WERE] looking in our baby last night, he WAS SLEEPING.

    !!! failure ""
        问题一：
        
        独立主格：没有谓语的状语从句 when we looking ... 就独立主格来说，这句可以这样写---什么鬼东西
        
        就考察时态来说，这里需要谓语，were looking
        
        当……的时候，是个点时间，主干谓语用进行时
        
        look in 看望
        
        look in on one's laster 晚些来看谁
        
        问题二：
        
        ~~because 从句结构要完整，he WAS smiling~~
        
        ---
        
        杨倩
        
        dreamed 通用的概念，笑的时候在做梦，并没有说一定是笑的同时在做梦
        
        如果是WAS DREAMING那就是同时
        
        所以这里都行
        
        SMILLED笑的那一刻，那么前面WAS DREAMING更合理
        
        状语必须有连词，
    
    dream 因为正在笑，所以正在做梦，dreamed 表示已经做完梦了，was dreaming

5. He (work){++was woking++} on his car in the garage when the gas tank (explode){++exploded++}.
6. At this time yesterday , I was at the bookstore .I (look ){++looked++} for the books I needed to buy for this class . 

    !!! failure ""
        At this time yesterday 具体的点时间，用进行时
        
        I WAS looking
    
7. Jane is expecting a letter from me ,but I (not  write ){++have not written++} to her yet .
    
    !!! failure ""
        
        is expecting 现在进行时的一个用法，不表示正在干嘛，表示这段时间的一个持续的状态
        
8. I sometime visit my mother on weekends . I (visit ){++visit++} them twice this month . 

    !!! failure ""
    
        twice **this** month 强调这个月，一般过去 VISITED
        
9. I work at New Oriental School . I (work){++have worked++} there for 10 years .
10. I take English lessons .I (take){++have taken++} English class since I was ten years old .

    !!! failure ""
    
        SINCE+前点时间 / FOR+一段未知时间 / BY+后点时间 / **LAST v.| During prep.+持续到现在的时间 【这个情况很特殊，见下面详解】**
        
        1.由完成时，延展问题：last 和 during 的区别 ==主要区别，last 是动词，during 是介词，用法不同==
        
        during 是在过去的一段时间里，last动词时表示持续一段时间
        
        **during 过去一段时间：during X to Y 做时间状语**
        
        **last的话，就不是状语了，就是这个事儿 last 了多少年，是谓语**
        
        下了5分钟雨：The rain last 5 minutes.
        
        雨持续下了5分钟：
        
        It was rainning during THE PAST 5 minutes.
        
        During the past 5 minutes, it was rainning.
        
        在完成时，DURING THE LAST / PAST 就仅现在而言，在过去一段时间里
        
        Last 因为是动词，所以一般现在时的时候，就是只就现在而言，刚刚持续了一段时间
    
        2.那么 last 和 during 什么情况下使用完成时
        
        2.1 ==**DURING是否强调到现在为止，如果不强调，那么可以使用其他时态**==
        
        During the past 5 years, I have written this book.
        
        强调这五年一直在写，到现在为止。【并且到现在不再写了】用过去时；如果还一直在写，到现在还在写，那就是现在完成时，During the past 5 years, I have been writing this book.
        
        2.2 Last 不能在完成时中单独使用，因为是动词，要用的话需要结合 during 满足 during the last 结构，这时的 last 是形容词
        
        ---
        
        杨倩
        
        I have been studing for 5 hours. 我过去在学，现在也在学，将来还在学
        
        I have studied for 5 hours. 我过去在学，现在学，将来不知道

11. You (ask){++have asked++} me five or six questions since we began this exercise .

        and 连接连个句子并列的问题
        
        没有逗号，是否可以省略前面相同的内容，
        
        有逗号，前后句子结构是否要完整？回答，有无逗号无关，and 连词最重要，同样可以省略 I
        
        ---
        杨倩
        
        加逗号，是因为句子太长了
        
        如果 and 前后都是 I AM 可以省略，如果前面是 do，后面是 am，因为是系动词，与前面不是一种类型，所以不能省略
        
        

12. I (talk){++have talked++} for the last five minutes . I (start ){++started++} talking to you five minutes ago , and I am still talking to you .
13. Right now , I am sitting in the classroom .And at this exact time tomorrow , I (sit){++will be sitting++} in the classroom .

18. We were late to have dinner at the restaurant .When we got there , it (close ){++has closed++} for the night .

        When we **got** there 过去，那么是过去的过去，HAD BEEN CLOSED
