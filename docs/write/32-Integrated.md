Point in the passage that Russian are three theories that the noises were calls of whales during a courtship ritual, the sounds were caused by giant squid and might have been emitted by foreign submarines, the experts argues that they can not be sure what caused by the sounds and cite some problems about reading material.

First of all, the reading material claim that the submarines crews believe that the noises were calls of whales during a courtship ritual. While the listening material disagree with these points by stating that the experts can not be what caused them and cite certain problems. First, whales is unlikely. Whales mostly live near the surface of water. The submarines typically deep in the ocean and should not have been able to hear the whales sounds from near the surface.  Furthermore, the whales would have been detected by sonar if they near the surface. 

Another important point mentioned in the reading material is that the sounds were caused by giant squid. However, the listening a conflicting idea that giant squid have always lived in the ocean where the submarines were patrolling and continue to live there today. If these were squid sounds, they would be no reason to suddenly in on decades and twenty years later.

Finally, the experts demonstrate that the sounds is not submarines from another country, which challenges the standpoint made by the writer who said that the sounds might have been emitted by foreign submarines. Because the sources of the sounds appeared to move around and change very quickly, but submarines cannot move and change quickly. Also today, we don't have technology to build submarines that are that fast and have engines that are that silent.
