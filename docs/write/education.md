Do agree or disagree with the following satement: It is easier nowadays to get educated than before.

University fee in many counties can be quite expensive nowadays, and this may lead some to believe that education is becoming less obtainable than before. This is untrue, however. If we look at a big picture, it is actually easier for most people to get an education in today's society compared to in the past.

To begin with, getting educated has been made easier in many ways thanks to computerization. One big change is how distance education has made it possible for people to access educational resources and earn advanced degrees from the comfort of their homes. whereas, before people needed to move to big cities or towns to get a good education, now they can take online courses and receive quality instruction even in rural and remote areas. Computerization has brought lots of small changes too. Electronic dictionaries enable us to look up words more efficiently. Education computer programs and smart-phone apps make it possible for us to interect with information in more vivid ways. Watching informative videos online can stimulate interest to outside of classroom.

Additionally, education has become more attainable because it is no longer restricted to upper-classes of society. While in the past only the rich could afford tuition fees for prestigious institutions, today good schools has become a higher priority in today's society, private tutors are also more common and no longer reserved only for high-class families. As long as they have determination, anyone can receive tutoring, attend a university, and gain academic qualifications. Even if they cannot afford to pay tuition, determined students can obtain scholarships or take out students loans.

Finally, in most counties today, governments have a greater involvement in promoting education. In China, for example, education is compulsory from grades 1-9. The government has even created programs to send teacher to less developed areas in order to ensure that everyone receives this minimun level of schooling. Some remian illiterate despite this, but on the whole, literacy has become far more widespread. China has also implemented government-sponsored exchange programs which give students a chance to study abroad. In contrast to before, when governments only really concerned themselves with the education of elites, nowadays governments are very involved in the education of ordinary citizens.

In conclustion, education is becoming more and more accessiable due to a number of factors: Computerization has given us new and interesting ways to learn, schooling is no longer restricted to elite, and government has become more involved in educating ther citizens. Overall, getting education has become easier for everyone in modern times.

A./D. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Teachers had a greater influence on young people in the past than they do today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Teachers have always been an important part of human society. Some believe that the golden age of teachers has already passed--that teachers no longer have influence over our youth like the teachers of the past did. I disagree.

For one thing, more people are attending school than before, so teachers are able to influence to young people on a lager scale than before. On reason more people are going to school is because primary and secondary education are now compulsory in most countries, with some countries like Chile even implementing free schooling up to the age of 21. Another reason is that higher education is receiving more attention, with scholarship allowing exceptional students to study for free or cheaply, study loans giving all students alternative way to pay for university, and goverment-sponsored exchange programs enabling students to study in foreign countries. Even people in rural and remote areas are going a chance to go to school thanks to governmental involvement. Because of these factors, teachers today are able to affect the lives of more people.

For another thing, education is seen as a higher priority now than in the past, so teachers are considered more important to young people's development this day and age. This is especially true with regard to minorities and women, because we now know that a lot of race and gender inequalities stem from education imbalance. The men and women teaching in our academic institutions today are not only increasing literacy  and imparting wisdom, they are also helping to rebalance society by helping young illiterate people from disadvantaged groups get the qualifications they need to compete equally.
> 另一点，教育在现在相比以前很重要，所以现在老师认为对年轻人发张更重要。就于少数和女性尤其真实，因为我们现在知道大量的竞争和性别不平等来自教育失衡。今天男性和女性在我们的学院制度下受教育不仅增长识字和传授智慧，他们也可以帮助社会重新平衡，通过帮助来自不利地位群体的文盲年轻人获得他们想要公平竞争的资格。

Finally, teachers are able to influence young people in new ways thanks to technological resources they now have. The computerization of classrooms, for instance, has allowed teachers to present information in more vivid ways. Instead of merely describing a chemical reaction, they can use a CGI video to show how two chemicals interact at the atomic level. This would stimulate a student's interest much more easily.  The growing popularity of distance education also means that teachers nowadays can reach students who are studying at home. Teachers can now reach students who cannot necessarily pay for private tutors or afford expensive tuition fees by instead teaching them through more affordable online courses. Today's technology enable teachers to convey knowledge like never before, and with greater efficiency.
> 最后，老师能以新的方式影响年轻人由于他们现在拥有的技术资源。例如，教室的计算机化使教师能以更生动的方式呈现信息。取代仅仅描述一个化学品反应，他们可以使用CGI视频展示在原子层的两个化学品的互相影响。这个能够更容易的激发学生的兴趣。远程教育的越来越受欢迎也意味着教师如今能接触到在家学习的学生。教师现在能接触到无法必须支付私人教师或者无法承担昂贵学费的学生，通过更能承担的在线教育取代教他们。今天的技术能够使教师不再像以前那样传递知识，并且有更大的影响力。

In summary, teachers today are no less influential than teachers in the past. If anything, the combination of more people attending school, education being seen as a higher priority, and new techlogical resources becoming available have all made teachers today more influential towards young people, not less.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statment? Parents should spend time with theire children helping them with schoolwork rather than playing games and sports. User specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

A child's life ==is full of `sth 充满充斥着`==  experiences that will come to ==shape and define `sb 塑造某人`==  them later on. Children need to play and be active, to explore the world physically; but they also begin the process of ==learning and acquiring knowledge `学习并获得知识`== , and ==expand== their ==`one's` mental capacities `开发某人的智商`== . What role should the parent play in the development? Ideally a parent should be involved in both, but in today's world, time is limited. ==Under these circumstances `在这些情况下`== , a parent should ==focus on `sth 专注某事`== their child with schoolwork.
> 一个孩子的一生充满着经历，这些经历可以在以后塑造他们。孩子们需要玩耍和积极的去探索这个实际上的世界；但是他们还好开始学习并获取知识的过程开发他们的智商。家长应该在这个发展中扮演什么角色？理想地家长应该参与到这两者当中，但是在今天的世界，时间是有限的。在这些情况下，家长应该关注孩子们的功课。

The most important reason for this is because parents should ==strive to `do sth 努力做某事`== discover where a child's strengths and passions lie, and then help ==cultivate== those ==strengthes and passions `培养能力和激情`== . This will ==make a huge impact on `sb 对某人有巨大影响`==  a child's future success -- and more importantly, also their future happniess. When I was younger I ==was== moderately ==interested in `sth 对某事感兴趣`== all subjects, but I ==had a particular bent for `sth 对某事有特别的偏好`==  art. My parents could see how excited I was about art homework compared to my other homework. Some parents might have ==quashed this interest `打压兴趣`== , declaring it impractical. They didn't. They encouraged me to pursue art, as long as I didn't neglect the rest of my studies. Since then, art has ==become an indispensable part of `sth 某事不可或缺 / 某事很重要`== my life and studies, and I ==am eternally grateful to `sb 感激某人`== my parents for that.
> 对于这件事最主要的原因是，因为家长们应该努力发现孩子的能力和激情在哪里，并帮助他们培养能力和激情。这样对孩子将来的成功有巨大的影响——并且更重要地，他们将来的幸福也有巨大的影响。当我年轻的时候我一般对所有科目感兴趣，但是我对艺术有特别的偏好。我的父母能够看到其他作业相比较，我做艺术作业多么兴奋。 一些家长可能会打压这些兴趣，说他不切实际。他们不这样。他们鼓励我追求艺术，只要我不忽略学习的休息。从那时起，艺术变成我生活和学习中不可或缺的部分，并且我感激我的父母这样做。

Another significant reason for parents to involve themselves in their children's schoolwork is the fact that job competition has grown tremendously. Helping your kids with homework is no longer optional. In order to a ==secure steady job `找一份稳定的工作`==, graduating with a bachelor's degree is no longer enough. With such ==a saturate job market `饱和的职场`==, parents need to help their kids find their calling early on, and then support them in pursuing that calling so they have a chance to ==distinguished== themselves ==oneself among== their ==one's peers `使得某人与众不同`==. Studies have found that over half recent university graduates are unemployed, employed only part-time, or working at a job far ==below== their ==one's qualifications `在某人能力之下`==. Without proper academic advice and guidance from parents, it is easy for children to grow up ==feeling somewhat directionless `失去方向感`== and ==fall victim to `sth 成为某事的牺牲品`== these circumstances.
> 对于父母将他们自己参与到孩子们的功课中另一个重要的原因是工作竞争的现实，竞争是巨大地。帮助你们的孩子完成家庭作业不再是可选择的。为了找一份稳定的工作，拿到学士学位角度的毕业是不够的。在这些饱和的工作市场中，父母需要早些帮助他们的孩子找到他们的行业，然后支持他们追求该行业，因此他们有机会在他们的同龄人中与众不同。研究发现最近的大学毕业生超过半数没有就业，就业仅仅是兼职或者工作在远低于他们学历的职位上。没有来自父母的合适的学院建议和指导，孩子的成长很容易感到失去方向和成为这些情况的牺牲品。

Finally, children have many friends to teach them how to play, but only parents can really teach them how to work. Most children do not enjoy schoolwork. If give a choice, they will want to play games and sports. They will have plenty opportunities to do so with their friends. It is only from parents that they can learn importance of hard work and discipline, because it is only parents who have the benifit of life experience. Of course, children will resist. They may even ==resent== their ==one's parents `怨恨父母`== at times.  But it is the parent's job to sometimes be the "bad guy", because nobody else will teach the child if the parents doesn't. Trough helping children with schoolwork, parents can ==instill the mentality values `灌输精神价值观`== that will allow children to sucessfully ==purse== their ==one's ambitions `追求理想`==.
> 最后，孩子们有很多朋友教给他们如何去玩，但是只有父母能真正地教给他们如何工作。大多数的孩子不喜欢做功课。如果给一个机会，他们想去玩游戏和运动。只能从父母那里学到努力工作和纪律的重要性，因为只有父母有生活经验的收获。当然，孩子们会抵抗。他们甚至在这个时候怨恨他们的父母。但是父母的工作有时使他们成为“坏人”，因为如果他们不教，没有其他人能教孩子。通过帮助孩子们做功课，家长可以逐渐灌输精神价值观，这些可以使孩子们成功地追求他们的理想。

A child's development needs to carefully balanced between play and work in order for them to find their true passion and succeed later in life. While friends can take care of "play", it is up to parents to ==impart the difficlut lessions of `sth 传授……艰难的一课`== "work".
