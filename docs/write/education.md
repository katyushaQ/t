Do agree or disagree with the following satement: It is easier nowadays to get educated than before.

University fee in many counties can be quite expensive nowadays, and this may lead some to believe that education is becoming less obtainable than before. This is untrue, however. If we look at a big picture, it is actually easier for most people to get an education in today's society compared to in the past.

To begin with, getting educated has been made easier in many ways thanks to computerization. One big change is how distance education has made it possible for people to access educational resources and earn advanced degrees from the comfort of their homes. whereas, before people needed to move to big cities or towns to get a good education, now they can take online courses and receive quality instruction even in rural and remote areas. Computerization has brought lots of small changes too. Electronic dictionaries enable us to look up words more efficiently. Education computer programs and smart-phone apps make it possible for us to interect with information in more vivid ways. Watching informative videos online can stimulate interest to outside of classroom.

Additionally, education has become more attainable because it is no longer restricted to upper-classes of society. While in the past only the rich could afford tuition fees for prestigious institutions, today good schools has become a higher priority in today's society, private tutors are also more common and no longer reserved only for high-class families. As long as they have determination, anyone can receive tutoring, attend a university, and gain academic qualifications. Even if they cannot afford to pay tuition, determined students can obtain scholarships or take out students loans.

Finally, in most counties today, governments have a greater involvement in promoting education. In China, for example, education is compulsory from grades 1-9. The government has even created programs to send teacher to less developed areas in order to ensure that everyone receives this minimun level of schooling. Some remian illiterate despite this, but on the whole, literacy has become far more widespread. China has also implemented government-sponsored exchange programs which give students a chance to study abroad. In contrast to before, when governments only really concerned themselves with the education of elites, nowadays governments are very involved in the education of ordinary citizens.

In conclustion, education is becoming more and more accessiable due to a number of factors: Computerization has given us new and interesting ways to learn, schooling is no longer restricted to elite, and government has become more involved in educating ther citizens. Overall, getting education has become easier for everyone in modern times.

A./D. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Teachers had a greater influence on young people in the past than they do today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Teachers have always been an important part of human society. Some believe that the golden age of teachers has already passed--that teachers no longer have influence over our youth like the teachers of the past did. I disagree.

For one thing, more people are attending school than before, so teachers are able to influence to young people on a lager scale than before. On reason more people are going to school is because primary and secondary education are now compulsory in most countries, with some countries like Chile even implementing free schooling up to the age of 21. Another reason is that higher education is receiving more attention, with scholarship allowing exceptional students to study for free or cheaply, study loans giving all students alternative way to pay for university, and goverment-sponsored exchange programs enabling students to study in foreign countries. Even people in rural and remote areas are going a chance to go to school thanks to governmental involvement. Because of these factors, teachers today are able to affect the lives of more people.

For another thing, education is seen as a higher priority now than in the past, so teachers are considered more important to young people's development this day and age. This is especially true with regard to minorities and women, because we now know that a lot of race and gender inequalities stem from education imbalance. The men and women teaching in our academic institutions today are not only increasing literacy  and imparting wisdom, they are also helping to rebalance society by helping young illiterate people from disadvantaged groups get the qualifications they need to compete equally.
> 另一点，教育在现在相比以前很重要，所以现在老师认为对年轻人发张更重要。就于少数和女性尤其真实，因为我们现在知道大量的竞争和性别不平等来自教育失衡。今天男性和女性在我们的学院制度下受教育不仅增长识字和传授智慧，他们也可以帮助社会重新平衡，通过帮助来自不利地位群体的文盲年轻人获得他们想要公平竞争的资格。

Finally, teachers are able to influence young people in new ways thanks to technological, resources they now have. The computerization of classrooms, for instance, has allowed teachers to present information in more vivid ways. Instead of merely describing a chemical reaction, they can use a CGI video to show how two chemicals interact at the atomic level. This would stimulate a student's interest much more easily.  The growing popularity of distance education also means that teachers nowadays can reach students who are studying at home. Teachers can now reach students who cannot necessarily pay for private tutors or afford expensive tuition fees by instead teaching them through more affordable online courses. Today's technology enable teachers to convey knowledge like never before, and with greater efficiency.
