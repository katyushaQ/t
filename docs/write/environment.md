Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Government should spend more money on evironment protection than economic development.

A question central to today's environment debate is how economic development and environment protection interlate. Some people maintain that governments should invest more in solving evironmental issues. I agree three reasons listed below.

Firstly, it would be for the sake of sutainable development. Obviously, economic targets cannot be met without some degree of environmental sacrifice, but as a result, goverments should strive to compensate for such losses. Take chemical factories for example. In the past, they would release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pour waste directly into rivers in their vicinity, which would contribute to global warmming and lead to the  degradation of local water supplies and the death of aquatic life. Not only that, but they would also threaten the liveihoods of those depending on the land for survival. In the long run, the factories, would have to be shut down because of the damage they caused. This could have been avoided if they used proper waste desposal systems, but they were reluctant to do so because they wanted to cut costs and maximize profits. It is these cases that government should step forward and take a stand. Fox example, governments could provide funding for waste purification systems or eco-friendly equipment in order to reduce waste and minimize pollution. Since customers are keen to buy products made by an environmentally conscious business, green industries are likely to enjoy better economic growth and a longer lifespan. 

Secondly, in this era of globalization, environmental protection helps to strengthen a country's international status. China has become one of the world's largest polluters. According to China's National Climate Change Program, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China, China's greenhouse gas emissions have grown at least 30% from 1999 to 2009. In addition, deforestation due to logging and land development has lead to the destruction of huge swaths of China's wilderness. The destruction of these habitats has already driven many species to the brink of extinction, including the South China tiger and the giant panda. If the government does nothing about the country's environmental issues, the will receive pressure from the international community and may face reduced trade and cooperation with other countries.

Lastly, governments should invest in solving environmental problems simply because they are in the best postion to do so. Businesses can find other private sources of funding, whereas the ability to fix pervasive environmental issues necessarily depends on planning, regulation, and funding that is both centralized and massive in scope. Businesses for the most part lack an economic incentive to be environmentally firendly, and even if this weren't the case, a single business could only create positive environmental changes locally. The push will never come from them. The task of saving the environment thus falls to governments, which happen to be the bodies with the most power——and thus the most responsibility—— to promote environmentally friendly practices anyway.

All in all, it is strongly advisable for governments to allocate more funds toward environmental preservation rather than economic development.
