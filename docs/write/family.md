Do you agree or disagree: parents should be let children make mistake and learn from the experience?

Parental guidance can be very influential in  a child's development. In addition to in heriting their parent's genes, children can also pick up their parents behavior, preferences, and temper. As their children's role models, parents pass down values and wisdom by demonstrating how to confront challenges, solve problems, and interact each other. Because of this, the parent-child bond is critical to a child's growth. However, in my opinion
excessive guidance and protection is not very constructive. In fact, it can actually be harmful to a child's growth since this type of parenting will reduce a child's ability to adapt to = adjust to the real world. Parents should allow their children to make mistakes and learn from these experience.

Although parents wants his or her child to succeed, learing how to handle failure is an important part of growing up. Children must learn to get back on their feet after making mistakes. When overprotective parents carefully arrange every aspect of children's lives, thep deprive their children of opportunities to make mistackes. After their children grow up and must begin to fend for themselves, they feel helpless and frustrated because their parents no longer solve problems for them.

Children must be given the freedom to make independent and sometimes incorrect dicisions. Parents often find it difficult to overcome their protective instincts because they are committed to boosting the confidence of their children. This will lead to their children becoming spoiled, sheltered, and unable to take care of themselves. For example, my 11 years old cousin never had to take care of herself becasuse she was surrounded by their parents and grandparents who take care of her. When she first attended boarding school, she called home every day and cried about the difference problems she encountered. Such as the difficulty of having to living with roommates or wash her clothes. Yet, to her parent's surperise, within weeks she had gotten used to her new surroundings. Children are able to adapt to unfamiliar environments on their own, but they must first be given the opportunity to do so. Otherwise, when they grow older, they won't be able to manage their lives without outside assistance.

It is therefore crucial for children to make mistakes and experience failures. This will be beneficial to their ability to cope of life's low points and rise above them. Although obedient children may seem more successful by the end of their academic careers, they eventually have to face real world problems by themselves when they begin their professional lives. Parents have to nurture their children's ability to grow independently.
