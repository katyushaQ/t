### The theme paragraph of some benefits of big cities.

**Medical treatment**

First of all, the big city has the advantage of providing people with numerous medical treatment. There are various types of doctors currently available, almost all patients are able to get accurately once they arrive hospitals. Some special facilities for examing bodies are even used so that the doctors are able to know what people's issues as results. On the contrary, as much as sick persons wish to have the same doctor who commonly service for them and highly know themselves, the unique doctor is unable to skill all characters of each detail department, which is result in some illness that might be delayed. For example, the classmate's grandfather who lived in a small village ran a high fever, the doctor believed him just cating a cold and gave him some simple cold medicine. However, the old man not only did not be treated but also his states of an illness are more seriously developed. The classmate immediately contacted the urban hospitals and moved him to one of the big city. There were three doctors to take an academic discusstion for this case, and consistently considered his states is SARS. More than that, doctors took isolation with them contributed to others safety. Therefore, the big city is much more influenced by medical treatment than rural clinics.

**20. It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.**

The big city has numerous benefits for children growing up than the countryside. For one thing, there are numbers of school in the big city. Parents could choose ~~appropiate~~ appropriate university which ~~accord~~ accords to children's speciality. A girl, for example, favorites performance such as singing a song, playing the violin and acting a person. In this case, parents can select Beijing Film Academy or Shanghai Theatre Academy because of both belong to Art college. Also, there are various interesting communities in every university. It makes ~~possilbe~~ possible for children to join some diverse organization at out-of-class time. Children will be cultivated sharing and expressing abilities in a Reading Team, and will be enhanced their ~~coorperation~~ cooperation with other membership in a Sport community as the Basketball School Team.

Nowadays, It is convenient that getting educated has been easier in many ways thanks to computerization. Children can use distance education to access educational resource and earn advanced degrees from the countryside, and thus they no longer move to big cities to get a good education, now they can take online courses and receive quality instruction even in rural and remote areas. Moreover, closing nature allows children to become much more sincere and simple person.

**19. Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop`形成[观点]` your essay.**

In my opinion, governments should spend more money on ~~impoving~~ improving roads and highways because they offer an opportunity to ==pass more cars, bicycles and people==. Nowaday, the roads and highways become highly tense with the urban population gradually increasing. ==More than that==, every adult having a personal car results in those cars ==parking beside roads, occupying way of bicycles, and crowding highways==. ==Worse yet==, people ~~has~~ have to get up earlier for avoiding rush hours, otherwise they will be late and even miss important contents of ~~courese~~ courses. ==Furthermore==, as more people choosing driving manner for vacation, governments should develop majority highways through every city and surrounding suburb and construct various roads in ~~villeges~~ villages.

---

Public transportation has ==numerous== ==benefits of being convenient, economical and punctual==. ==First==, the convenience is very important for a cosmopolis. As a big city, ==there are== numerous people attending school, going to {++a++} tourist resort and visiting customers, generating ~~substainal~~ substantial ~~transportaion~~ transportation capacity. Building more buses or subways can reduce {++the++} interval time and can carry more people -  ==no matter where== they want to go. ==Also==, there is more economical than private car. ==Since== we just pay five dollars for trains from south to east of {++the++} city, but we will spend about twenty dollars by car and additional ten dollars for parking. Therefore, the trains are more appropriate than cars. ==More than that==, the subways {++is++} are very punctual. Since time is vitally important for {++the++} businessman, subways contribute to save their time. 

**18. What are some important qualities of a good supervisor`主管` (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.**

A good supervisor should have ==numerous== necessary qualities. ==For one thing==, ~~A~~ a good supervisor should own the ability of negotiation and people skills. In the team, ==for example==, the supervisor generally has lots of jobs that must be allocated to different professional clerks and be merged everyone's results at the end of project. In such case, the supervisor ~~usurally~~ usually takes approximatelly seventy percent ~~times~~ time to assign tasks and harmonize some problems for the coordination, ==in order to== make people collaborate with others. ==In addition==, a good supervisor should master impressive professional knowledge and skills. These characters will ==contribute== supervisor ==to== decide the direction of team development and help the subordinates to solve practical problems. ==More than that==, a good supervisor should be willing to work with other team members. That can help individual to perform their very best and put work into action.

**17. Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.**

I prefer to learn better by myself than with a teacher. ==~~First of all~~ For one thing==, the tutoring is ==extremely expensive== - ==no matter which== lession I want to study. ==For example==, the ~~cost~~ costs have occupied approximately 50 percent of {++the++} budget of my hobby. ==Specifically==, in my photograph and swimming courses, I will spend six hundreds RMB on one course which is two hours. ==Morever==, nowadays I will use the highly advanced internet to access various websites for learning everything. I can get lots of information ~~from~~ on professional websites, and can participate in many discussing team. As a participant, I can join kinds of community and enjoy all the benefits of membership, ==from== ~~comunicated~~ communicated technology, exchanged opinions, and shared experiences ==to== a sense of ~~archivment~~ achievement. ==Better yet==, during the period, I can learn numerous practical knowledge~~s~~ which the teach{++er++} will not convey.

But we can consult teachers who will use the illustration with oral ~~percise~~ precise ~~decription~~ description to explain it when we in doubt. ==More than that==, ~~the~~ teachers usually arrange some assignments after class to students, {--contributing to--} checkING and enhanceING student's ability of mastering with regard to knowledge. ==Also==, students will pay attention more easily to study by the face-to-face teaching. ==Since== the teachers often instruct numerous knowledge points in the class that usually ~~fourty~~ forty five minutes, they may speak speedly very much. In this case, students have to highly concentrate to follow speech. Otherwise, they will lose some ~~impoartant~~ important ~~informations~~ information.

**16. It has recently been announced that a new restaurant may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.**

It ==has numerous benefits of== the new restaurant closing to my home, because it offers a convenient place to eat or relax for us. As a student, I have to quicky eat my breakfast and buy kinds of food to my boy friend who are always late for class recently. ==Specifically==, we are generally busy writing papers at the end of semester, go eating any time ==no matter when== we feel hungry. ==Moreover==, in the spare time, the new restaurant has made it possible for people to give a party. From time to gather friends ==contributes to== promote the relationship to anyone else. ==Having a birthday party, ~~congraduating~~ congratulating someone's graduation, and meeting old friends== are all good life ~~experence~~ experiences. ==Nothing can be more satisfying than it==.

The new restaurant to be constructed in our block ==~~don't~~ dose not make ~~sence~~ SENSE==. ==First==, the process of building an ~~architechture~~ architecture is ~~hamful~~ harmful to residents of the street - ==no matter what== is wonderfully decorated.

**Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?**

The big city has ==numerous== benefits. ==For one thing==, It has convenient public transportation. It has makes it possible for people to exchange various lines by ==bus, subway or taxi== when they go to work from home or elsewhere. If you want to go a position, ==there might be== several lines for you selecting in most situations. ==For example==, my univercity at CBD center and about ten miles away from my home, I ==have to no warry about being== late ==because== there are at least two lines which I choice. ==Also==, There are a lot of convenience in the big city. ==No one has to worry about== to buy the living goods. ==Since== we always learn or work late into the night and feel hungry, ==needing== to find some dessert to eat from store that is the 24-hours opened such as 711, McDonald's or KFC.

---

==Even though== a big city ==has advantages of being== ==convenient, speedy and economical==, I believe a small town is beneficial to residence. ==For one thing==, people of city is relately cool ==because== their rhythm of live is extremely fast. But the person of the small town is ==more== simplicity and warmth ==than== the urban person. They who has slow live style usually take a smile and say hello positively, ==walking== the dog when they meet you.Actually, we are strager. And, when the festival coming, people of one street takes a party which have a lot of delicious foods that include chicken, bread, chips, vegetables, and beverages and programs which contain sing, dance, and so on, as well as many gifts for children. people is looks like a big family. ==Also==, There ==nothing can be more satisfying than== living in a small town. Most of landspace has ==numerous== plants such as pine trees, rose flowers and some kinds of shrubs. It looks like a big vivid painting, therefore I enjoy this enverinment. So the small city is ==not== really for business working. ==Rather==, it is good for living.

**11. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? “Universities should give the same amount of money to their students’ sports activities as they give to their university libraries.” Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.**

Because students of university always having numerous assignments ~~of~~ to each ~~caurse~~ course, they need kinds of sports activities for doing physical exercise and releasing their stress of study. Therefore, I agree that the university should provide the same amount of money for students' sports activities. For one ~~things~~ {++THING++}, the sports activities ~~needs~~ need to rent a huge space. There are over hundreds of students in every ~~colloge~~ college, it is used to supply racing areas and set a lot of seats ~~for~~ of audience. Also, several types of sports activities have various instrument which will be consumed by sporters, be cleaned and repaired by workers. Such as, whistle, starting gun, flags and so forth. The sport activities are held every week, everyone will join in it no matter what times and has to worry about not ~~droping~~ dropping the classes. There is more satisfying than other items.

Even though sports activities have advantages of helping students to be healthy, friendly and positive, I believe that the libraries ~~is~~ are better than sports activities in a mount of money for them. One things, there are numerous types of books in the libraries, such as computer science and technology, historiography and ~~philosopy~~ philosophy and various kinds of information and illustration in these books. The students usually want to browse and study professional data ~~of~~ onto their major and minor courses in the libraries, they will be used for their papers or examination. Since the professor will select some of {++the++} typical and classical theories and instances into test papers. For this reason, the libraries need much more ~~space~~ spaces to support it. Also, the libraries need to repair books and even buy new one. Since these books ~~is~~ are frequently borrowed or rented by students, they will be damaged or lost. In conclusion, the same money ~~is~~ {++are++} more important to libraries than sport ~~actitives~~ activities.

**12. Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.**

The museums have numerous kinds of exhibition no matter what you want to see. For example, when I have been the museum of Toronto, there is a huge, brown, and artistic building in front of me. As it attracted me instantly, I decided to visit it. There are four floors and ~~a~~ {++an++} ~~extracitve~~ {++extensional++} floor at ~~undergroud~~ {++underground++}, and several ~~area~~ {++areas++} of theme ~~in~~ {++from/of++} the same layer. The first floor, for instance, sector one is used to ~~intruduce~~ {++introduce++} the origin of the Niagara Falls. Sector two is shown that the original inhabitants how to live and develop. Sector three is ~~exhibit~~ {++exhibting++} the china, it surprised me because I prided as a Chinese when I was ~~heared~~ {++heart++} the ancient information ~~from~~ {++about/on++} foreigner. In addition, there is the whale heart show in the B1 floor. It exhibted the whale was endangered by environment ~~pullution~~ {++pollution++} or human's hunt, so show has shocked me. The whale looks like very kindness, ~~intellent~~ {++intelligent++}, and harmless, their heart size as big as a smart car, amount of {--tooth--} {++teeth++} likes a series bunch of brush, and the size ~~about~~ {++of++} between fifteen and twenty meters long. All these exhibition had ~~a~~ {++an++} information signs {++of++} beside the showing subject. There are various ~~instreasting~~ {++interesting++} knowledges or tips on it. Therefore, I have gained a lot from the museums, {++AND++} thus I suggest everybody to visit the museum when they ~~travle~~ {++travel++}. {--Because {--every--} {++NO++}body has to worry about not to learn nothing, so nothing can be more satisfying than it--}. 
==TO SUM UP, nothing can be more satisfying than VISITING MUSEUM WHEN TRALVING to new places==

**13. Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.**

It has numerous benefits that we prepare and eat food at home. For one thing, the materials of food are fresher and cleaner than restaurants. Since people always cautiously select it in supermarkets and clear itself muds and some ~~agricultrual~~ {++agricultural++} remains, there is enough guarantee of our food. Also, the preparing process is very interesting among the family. Everybody enjoys in it, mixing salad, roasting beef, and cooking soup. There are various alternative food for each one's taste. Finally, they are eating together with talking, joking and laughing. Nothing can be more satisfying than a big family merrily eating food at home.

Even though preparing and eating food at home has advantages of being happy{--iness--}, harmonious and healthy, I believe that eat at food stand or restaurants is better than home. For example, there are numerous kinds of food to support you to choose ~~in~~ {++from++} the restaurants. The McDonald's provides hamburgers, chips and beverages for consumer. And as the special festival or the movie's relevant ~~activies~~ {++activities++}, they often introduce new kids set meal for children. Also, it is more convenient that we eat at stands. Because we always have fully schedule everyday, and then the lunch time is ~~shotter~~ {++shorter++} and tense very much, we have quickly to eat. Thereforce, the restaurants is the best choice.

I am a computer science and technology student and I suppos{--ed 过去这样认为，现在不这样认为--} that the university students {--should must 低级语法错误--} attend classes.

Also, there are some real computer operational classes for us with theory classes. Because the ~~pinciples~~ {++principles++} are abstractive very much, the operational classes can help students {++TO++} precisely {--to--} understand how and why computers are designed and run in this way, not only used. So attending classes is very ~~necessery~~ {++necessary++} to us.

Even though attending classes has advantages of being academic, systematic and detailed, I believe it has its downside too. For example, there is no guarantee of communication. The numerous classes usually are {++one-to-many++} lecture{++S++} {--which is ~~speeched~~ {++spoke++} one-to-many by professors--}, So the majority of students have no chance to discuss {++WITH 必须with++} each other and feel {--boring--} {++BORED++} very much. Also, there may be not practical courses for all major students. But it is very ~~impoartant~~ {++important++} {--to--} {++FOR++} the university student{++S++} {--that--} {--is--} {++ARE++} {--real drill--} {++TO DO PRACTICE++} {--in--} {++FROM++} which the students could learn how to cooperate with others, how to fix mistakes from advance suggestion and how to do the best themselves. Furthermore,  the real drill might be several forms, such as a sports competition, charity ~~activites~~ {++activities++}, or private tutoring. These ~~practice~~ {++practices++} are all ~~beneficail~~ {++beneficial++} to everybody. So going to courses should not be necessary for students.
