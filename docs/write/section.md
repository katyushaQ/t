**Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?**

The big city has ==numerous== benefits. ==For one thing==, It has convenient public transportation. It has makes it possible for people to exchange various lines by ==bus, subway or taxi== when they go to work from home or elsewhere. If you want to go a position, ==there might be== several lines for you selecting in most situations. ==For example==, my univercity at CBD center and about ten miles away from my home, I ==have to no warry about being== late ==because== there are at least two lines which I choice. ==Also==, There are a lot of convenience in the big city. ==No one has to worry about== to buy the living goods. ==Since== we always learn or work late into the night and feel hungry, ==needing== to find some dessert to eat from store that is the 24-hours opened such as 711, McDonald's or KFC.

==Even though== a big city ==has advantages of being== ==convenient, speedy and economical==, I believe a small town is beneficial to residence. ==For one thing==, people of city is relately cool ==because== their rhythm of live is extremely fast. But the person of the small town is ==more== simplicity and warmth ==than== the urban person. They who has slow live style usually take a smile and say hello positively, ==walking== the dog when they meet you.Actually, we are strager. And, when the festival coming, people of one street takes a party which have a lot of delicious foods that include chicken, bread, chips, vegetables, and beverages and programs which contain sing, dance, and so on, as well as many gifts for children. people is looks like a big family. ==Also==, There ==nothing can be more satisfying than== living in a small town. Most of landspace has ==numerous== plants such as pine trees, rose flowers and some kinds of shrubs. It looks like a big vivid painting, therefore I enjoy this enverinment. So the small city is ==not== really for business working. ==Rather==, it is good for living.

**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? “Universities should give the same amount of money to their students’ sports activities as they give to their university libraries.” Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.**

Because students of university always having numerous assignments ~~of~~ to each ~~caurse~~ course, they need kinds of sports activities for doing physical exercise and releasing their stress of study. Therefore, I agree that the university should provide the same amount of money for students' sports activities. For one things, the sports activities ~~needs~~ need to rent a huge space. There are over hundreds of students in every ~~colloge~~ college, it is used to supply racing areas and set a lot of seats ~~for~~ of audience. Also, several types of sports activities have various instrument which will be consumed by sporters, be cleaned and repaired by workers. Such as, whistle, starting gun, flags and so forth. The sport activities are held every week, everyone will join in it no matter what times and has to worry about not ~~droping~~ dropping the classes. There is more satisfying than other items.
