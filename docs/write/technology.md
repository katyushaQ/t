Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Technolog has more positive effects than negative ones.

Technolog has had a wide range of effects on society. Thought some of the effects are problematic, I think that for the most part these changes are benefical to our lives.

Firstly, technology has give us new ways to access information and interact with ecah other. In the past, people had to go to the local library  to access specialized information. If the library closed, they were out of luck. And if they wanted to contact people far away, they would have to write letters or pay expensive long-diatance land-line charges. Nowadays, by using website like Baidu or Google, people can quickly access up-to-date information regarding any area of human knowlege. And if they want to contact people far away, communication technologies like vides-chatting and mobile-phone=smart phone make it possible for people to commnunicate on a global scal.

Furthermore, technology has brougth numerous quality-of-life benefits. Time-saving applications like washing machines enable us to do chores more easily. Refregerators and genetic engineering helps us to preserve food for longer. Modern transportation systems make it less exhausting to get to work. Because of all there advances in technology, people can deal with the demands of life more easily. These technological aids have also given us more leisure time to spend with friends and family.

Granted=Admittedly, there is now a greater risk of overexposure to technology. For example, I currently use 3 different e-mail accounts, 5 different smart phone chat programs, and 4 different social media services. Having to stay updated on all of these can feel stressful at times and hamper my ability to be productive at work. Moreover, I also have to be carefull of viruses infecting my computer and hackers violateing my privacy. But at the end of day, this is small price to pay for the convenience of staying in touch with so many people. Plus, using a little common sence can reduce your chances of experiencing these problems. I can limit my time spent online to avoid overexposure, and as long as I'm start about what I download and who I give information to, viruses and privacy issus

e aren't a big deal.

In summary, techonology has not only aided our ability to learn and communicate each other, but it also enhanced our quality of life. It can be somewhat of a double-edged sword at times, but overall, technology's effects have been positive.

A./D.: Although technology will continue to improve, the most significant improvement of quality of people's lives has already taken place.
> 尽管技术会继续改善，但是人们的生活质量的最重要的改善已经发生。

It has been argued that ==despit `(sth)`== the continued advancement ==of the fact that `尽管……，……`== science and technology, our lives have changed in a way that is tremendous than ever. I, however, disagree.
> 这是有争议的，尽管科学和技术的持续发展，但是我们的生活已经在一个比任何都强有力的方法改变。然而，我不赞成。

First, environmental problems are still ==`be` on the waiting list `处于等待中`==. Technology-dominated  industrialization has generated such problems as ==global warming, acid rain and urban smog `haze 温室效应，酸雨和城市烟雾`, all of which have ==given rise to a serise of adverse effects `引起一系列负面的影响`== -- ==climate change, death of aquatic life `气候变化，水生物死亡`== and ==respiratory disease `呼吸系统疾病`==. Although the quality of life has improved, there are still many things that could be improved in China, like safety and living conditions. If the significant transformation in living standards has taken place, how is it possible that ecocide is still a real and ever-present danger?
> 首先，环境问题仍然在待解决中。技术统治的工业化已经产生这些问题如全球变暖，酸雨和城市雾霾，这些引起一系列负面的影响——气候变化，两栖生命的灭亡和呼吸疾病。尽管生活质量已经改善，仍然有许多事在中国要被改善，像安全和居住条件。如果重要的改观在居住标准上已经发生，怎么可能还会有真实的生态灭绝和始终存在的危险？
