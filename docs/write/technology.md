Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Technolog has more positive effects than negative ones.

Technolog has had a wide range of effects on society. Thought some of the effects are problematic, I think that for the most part these changes are benefical to our lives.

Firstly, technology has give us new ways to access information and interact with ecah other. In the past, people had to go to the local library  to access specialized information. If the library closed, they were out of luck. And if they wanted to contact people far away, they would have to write letters or pay expensive long-diatance land-line charges. Nowadays, by using website like Baidu or Google, people can quickly access up-to-date information regarding any area of human knowlege. And if they want to contact people far away, communication technologies like vides-chatting and mobile-phone=smart phone make it possible for people to commnunicate on a global scal.

Furthermore, technology has brougth numerous quality-of-life benefits. Time-saving applications like washing machines enable us to do chores more easily. Refregerators and genetic engineering helps us to preserve food for longer. Modern transportation systems make it less exhausting to get to work. Because of all there advances in technology, people can deal with the demands of life more easily. These technological aids have also given us more leisure time to spend with friends and family.

Granted=Admittedly, there is now a greater risk of overexposure to technology. For example, I currently use 3 different e-mail accounts, 5 different smart phone chat programs, and 4 different social media services. Having to stay updated on all of these can feel stressful at times and hamper my ability to be productive at work. Moreover, I also have to be carefull of viruses infecting my computer and hackers violateing my privacy. But at the end of day, this is small price to pay for the convenience of staying in touch with so many people. Plus, using a little common sence can reduce your chances of experiencing these problems. I can limit my time spent online to avoid overexposure, and as long as I'm start about what I download and who I give information to, viruses and privacy issus

e aren't a big deal.

In summary, techonology has not only aided our ability to learn and communicate each other, but it also enhanced our quality of life. It can be somewhat of a double-edged sword at times, but overall, technology's effects have been positive.
