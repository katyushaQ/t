What is the purpose of work? What do people work for?

Over time, with the growth of human civilization, the kinds of jobs available to people has grown tremendously. However, most people today still work for the same basic reasons that they did centuries ago.

Most people today probably work in order to earn money. These people may not acutally enjoy their professions, but they are willing to endure many hardships as long as they receive a paycheck. Some are the bread-winner in their families, so they have no choice but to work. Other value material things like luxury cars and designer clothes, so they work because it makes it possilbe for them to support their expensive lifestyle. Because their main motivation for working is money, they may not necessarily devote themselves fully to their jobs. Those who work mainly to earn money might not only aspire to do work that is "good enough" and do not care about feeling a sense of achievement.

There are also people who work for social status. For these individuals, salary may not be a significant factor. Or if it important, it only because a larger salary symbolized a higher level of importance in the company. Those who work for social status will usually ask for promotons more often than their peers and strive harder than others to receive recognition for their archievment. These are the types of people who try to climb the corporate ladder. There are usually highly competent and good at overcoming challenges, but many also step on others in order to gain a competitive edge.

Finally, there are those who work they are passionate about what they do. They get a sense of enjoyment from work because they love what they do, and not because of the salary they receive or the recognition they gain. Because of this, their dedication to their work will be superior to most people's. These people are probaly the rarest of all the types. An example of this might be an idealistic teacher who educates children in third-world countries. For them, the pleasure they get from their work is reward enough. Those who work in humanitarian or artistic fields probaly feel this way most often, though passionate people can be found in every field.

In conclusion, most people today work for money. There are also those who work for social status, though those people are more rare. Rarest of all are those who work because they are passionate about what they do.
