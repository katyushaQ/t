What is the purpose of work? What do people work for?

Over time, with the growth of human civilization, the kinds of jobs available to people has grown tremendously. However, most people today still work for the same basic reasons that they did centuries ago.

Most people today probably work in order to earn money. These people may not acutally enjoy their professions, but they are willing to endure many hardships as long as they receive a paycheck. Some are the bread-winner in their families, so they have no choice but to work. Other value material things like luxury cars and designer clothes, so they work because it makes it possilbe for them to support their expensive lifestyle. Because their main motivation for working is money, they may not necessarily devote themselves fully to their jobs. Those who work mainly to earn money might not only aspire to do work that is "good enough" and do not care about feeling a sense of achievement.

There are also people who work for social status. For these individuals, salary may not be a significant factor. Or if it important, it only because a larger salary symbolized a higher level of importance in the company. Those who work for social status will usually ask for promotons more often than their peers and strive harder than others to receive recognition for their archievment. These are the types of people who try to climb the corporate ladder. There are usually highly competent and good at overcoming challenges, but many also step on others in order to gain a competitive edge.

Finally, there are those who work they are passionate about what they do. They get a sense of enjoyment from work because they love what they do, and not because of the salary they receive or the recognition they gain. Because of this, their dedication to their work will be superior to most people's. These people are probaly the rarest of all the types. An example of this might be an idealistic teacher who educates children in third-world countries. For them, the pleasure they get from their work is reward enough. Those who work in humanitarian or artistic fields probaly feel this way most often, though passionate people can be found in every field.

In conclusion, most people today work for money. There are also those who work for social status, though those people are more rare. Rarest of all are those who work because they are passionate about what they do.

A./D. Should companies use public recognition to reward hard work instead of using money? Use specific example to support your answer.
> 公司应该使用公共认可去奖励努力工作而不是使用金钱吗？使用具体的例子支持你的答案。

Companies ==use== many ==tactics `用技巧方法`== to ==keep sb== employees ==motivated `激励某人`== and to ==boost company morale `提升公司道德底线`==. A primary way companies reward employees is with bonuses. Along with bonuses, they also give awards, like employee of the month, that also encourage employee to work harder. While public recognition of employee success ==`A` is an affective way to `do B A是做B最有效的方式`== reward hard work, these awards and titles mean nothing without the ==monetary bonus `钱`== that ==comes along with `伴随而来`== them.
> 公司使用许多技巧方法保持员工积极性和提高公司士气。一个主要的公司奖励员工的方法是奖金。与奖金一起，他们还给奖赏，如月的雇员，这个也鼓励雇员工作更努力。然而雇员成功的公共认可是奖励努力工作的最有效的方式，这些奖励和职称没有钱没有意义，他们伴随钱而来。

The main reason people work is to earn money so they can live comfortably. To be fair, many people do find satisfaction in their jobs beyond money, but money ==`A` is== undoubtedly ==a main drive `for sb to do sth A是某人做某事最重要的动机`== behind the work ethic of many employees. Titles will only motivate employees so much. For example, my cousin recently started working as a sales representative at a music store. He worked really hard as a sales representative, because he had a goal of getting promoted to a management level position. In no time my cousin was promoted to the assistance manager position, but he was disappointed to discover that this promotion came with a title only. He continued to receive the same salary and basically had the same job as before, except now he had a few more responsibilities. For my cousin, this public recognition of his dedication meant absolutely nothing to him once he discovered he did not get a pay raise. Now he's found another job that provides better compensation for hard work.
> 人们工作的主要原因是挣钱，这样他们才能舒服地生活。工作的讲，许多人要找在工作上称心超越金钱， 但是金钱无疑是支持许多雇员的工作伦理最重要的动机。支撑只会使雇员更积极。例如，我的亲戚最近开始作为一个销售代表在音乐店工作。他作为一个销售代表真的很努力，因为他有一个获得努力成为管理级别位置的目标。我的亲戚立刻努力帮助管理者位置，但是他失望的发现这个努力只得到一个职称而已。他继续收到相同的薪水，并且基本上和以前一样的工作，除了现在他一些更多的责任。就我亲戚而言，这个他投入的公共认可的对他绝对没有意义，自从他发现他没有得到薪水的提升。现在他发现另一个工作可以对努力工作提供更好的补偿。
