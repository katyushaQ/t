<p>Which of the following statements about fractures and cut marks can be inferred from paragraph 4?</p>
<p>○ Fractures and cut marks caused by right-handed soldiers tend to occur on the right side of the injured party's body.</p>
<p>○ The right arm sustains more injuries because, as the dominant arm, it is used more actively.</p>
<p>○ In most people, the left side of the body is more vulnerable to injury since it is not defended effectively by the dominant arm.</p>
<p>○ Fractures and cut marks on fossil humans probably occurred after death.</p>
