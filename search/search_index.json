Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other arboreal fodder. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be inferred from the discussion in paragraph 2 that winter conditions \n\n\n\u25cb cause some deer to hibernate \n\n\n\u25cb make food unavailable in the highlands for deer \n\n\n\u25cb make it easier for deer to locate understory plants \n\n\n\u25cb prevent deer from migrating during the winter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n\nParagraph 2\uff1a One of the most puzzling aspects of the paintings is their location. \n\n\nOther rock paintings\u2014for example, those of Bushmen in South Africa\u2014are either located near cave entrances or completely in the open. \n\n\nCave paintings in France and Spain, however, are in recesses and caverns far removed from original cave entrances. \n\n\nThis means that artists were forced to work in cramped spaces and without sources of natural light. \n\n\nIt also implies that whoever made them did not want them to be easily found. \n\n\nSince cave dwellers normally lived close to entrances, there must have been some reason why so many generations of Lascaux cave dwellers hid their art.\n\n\n\n\nParagraph 2\uff1a One of the most puzzling aspects of the paintings is their location.

In turn, a deep attachment to the land, and to the stability which rural life engenders, fostered the Roman virtues: gravitas, a sense of responsibility, peitas, a sense of devotion to family and country, and iustitia, a sense of the natural order.    Paragraph 3 suggests which of the following about the people of Latium?  \u25cbTheir economy was based on trade relations with other settlements.  \u25cbThey held different values than the people of Rome.  \u25cbAgriculture played a significant role in the society.  \u25cbThey possessed unusual knowledge of animal instincts.",

In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. \n||\n Thomas Edison's peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. \n\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff09\n It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. \n\uff08\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u7684\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u548c\u60c5\u51b5\uff09*For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).\n\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u8d39\u7528\uff09*\n\n\n\u6bb5\u843d\u4e3b\u65e8\uff1a\u6a21\u4eff\u7559\u58f0\u673a\u5385\u8bbe\u8ba1\n These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. \n||\n In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. \n\uff08\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83-\u76f8\u4f3c\uff09\n \n||\n Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately $10 to $15 each). He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine-a projector-from him instead of several.\n\uff08\u53d1\u8d22\u4e4b\u9053\uff09\n\n\n\u6bb5\u843d\u4e3b\u65e8\uff1a\u8868\u6f14\u8005\u8d5a\u94b1\u610f\u613f\n Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their profits, which they could do more readily by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission. \n||\n About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the assistance of Edison's former assistant, William Dickson) perfected projection devices. These early projection devices were used in vaudeville theaters, legitimate theaters, local town halls, makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and amusement parks to show films to a mass audience. \n\uff08\u9610\u8ff0Kp\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff09\n\n[When this widespread use of projection technology began to hurt his Kinetoscope business, Edison acquired a projector developed by Armat and introduced it as \u201cEdison\u2019s latest marvel, the Vitascope.]\n\n\nQ1\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u884c\u7684which\u6307\u4ee3\u8c01\uff1f\u662f\u524d\u9762\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u4e48\uff1f\n\nQ2\uff1a\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u7b2c\u4e8c\u53e5\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u9610\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e2a\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u548c\u7b2c\u4e00\u53e5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\n\nQ3\uff1a\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u9898\u7684\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6574\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u602a\u602a\u7684\uff1f\n\n\n\n\n\u6bb5\u843d\u4e3b\u65e8\uff1a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7247\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u4f17\u5f62\u5f0f\n With the advent of projection in 1895-1896, motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption. \n||\n Previously, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, popular dramas, musical and minstrel shows, classical plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. \n||\n But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.\n\uff08\u8f6c\u6298-\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u7535\u5f71\u5728\u5a31\u4e50\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5c55\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\n\n\n\u6bb5\u843d\u4e3b\u65e8\uff1a\u9610\u8ff0\u8868\u6f14\u8005\u7684\u8f9b\u82e6\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u4e8b\u5148\u5f55\u97f3\u53ca\u5176\u597d\u5904\u0010\u0010\u0010\n Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. \n||\n What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies; the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains, of waves striking the shore, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera.\n\uff08\u9012\u8fdb-\u9610\u8ff0\u5f55\u97f3\u590d\u5236\u54c1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\n\n\n\u6bb5\u843d\u4e3b\u65e8\uff1a\u9610\u8ff0\u89c2\u770b\u8005\u4e0e\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u518d\u79c1\u6709\u5316\uff0c\u4e3e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\n With the advent of projection, the viewer's relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. \n||\n It suddenly became public\u2014an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others.

            "text": "Cave Art in Europe  7/14\n\n\nThe earliest discovered traces of art are beads and carvings, and then paintings, from sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period. We might expect that early artistic efforts would be crude, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be even older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.\n\n\nThe researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the inner reaches of caves, whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.\n\n\nThe subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings rest on bare walls, with no backdrops or environmental trappings. Perhaps, like many contemporary peoples, Upper Paleolithic men and women believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury, and if that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art. Another explanation for the focus on animals might be that these people sought to improve their luck at hunting. This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings. But if improving their hunting luck was the chief motivation for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared. Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals. Cave art seems to have reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period, when the herds of game were decreasing.   \n\n\nThe particular symbolic significance of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson. The data they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In addition, the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their behavior. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people. Consistent with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming extinct), the art ceased to focus on portrayals of animals.\n\n\nUpper Paleolithic art was not confined to cave paintings. Many shafts of spears and similar objects were decorated with figures of animals. The anthropologist Alexander Marshack has an interesting interpretation of some of the engravings made during the Upper Paleolithic. He believes that as far back as 30,000 B.C., hunters may have used a system of notation, engraved on bone and stone, to mark phases of the Moon. If this is true, it would mean that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and were consciously aware of their environment. In addition to other artworks, figurines representing the human female in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper Paleolithic sites. It has been suggested that these figurines were an ideal type or an expression of a desire for fertility.",

            "text": "Deer Populations of the Puget Sound 3/14\n\n\nTwo species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The black-tailed deer, a lowland, west-side cousin of the mule deer of eastern Washington, is now the most common. The other species, the Columbian white-tailed deer, in earlier times was common in the open prairie country; it is now restricted to the low, marshy islands and flood plains along the lower Columbia River.\n\n\nNearly any kind of plant of the forest understory can be part of a deer's diet. Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow plants, the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other shrub or herb. But this is fair-weather feeding. What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy? One compensation for not hibernating is the built-in urge to migrate. Deer may move from high-elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall. Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other arboreal fodder.\n\n\nThe numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country. The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal. Famous explorers of the north American frontier, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive that winter, they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring, the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century, when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, deer populations continued to fluctuate. David Douglas, Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:\" The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops.\n\n\nReduction in numbers of game should have boded ill for their survival in later times. A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further. Recall the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer, now in a protected status. But for the black-tailed deer, human pressure has had just the opposite effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time, says that \"since the early 1940s, the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period.\"\n\n\nThe causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions. First, the major predators of deer\u2014wolves, cougar, and lynx\u2014have been greatly reduced in numbers. Second, conservation has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting. But the most profound reason for the restoration of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of lowland country deforested by logging, fire, or both have become ideal feeding grounds of deer. In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive. The protein content of shade-grown vegetation, for example, was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings.",

This is untrue, however. If we look at a big picture, it is actually easier for most people to get an education in today's society compared to in the past.\n\n\nTo begin with, getting educated has been made easier in many ways thanks to computerization. One big change is how distance education has made it possible for people to access educational resources and earn advanced degrees from the comfort of their homes. whereas, before people needed to move to big cities or towns to get a good education, now they can take online courses and receive quality instruction even in rural and remote areas. Computerization has brought lots of small changes too. Electronic dictionaries enable us to look up words more efficiently. Education computer programs and smart-phone apps make it possible for us to interect with information in more vivid ways. Watching informative videos online can stimulate interest to outside of classroom.\n\n\nAdditionally, education has become more attainable because it is no longer restricted to upper-classes of society. While in the past only the rich could afford tuition fees for prestigious institutions, today good schools has become a higher priority in today's society, private tutors are also more common and no longer reserved only for high-class families. As long as they have determination, anyone can receive tutoring, attend a university, and gain academic qualifications. Even if they cannot afford to pay tuition, determined students can obtain scholarships or take out students loans.\n\n\nFinally, in most counties today, governments have a greater involvement in promoting education. In China, for example, education is compulsory from grades 1-9. The government has even created programs to send teacher to less developed areas in order to ensure that everyone receives this minimun level of schooling. Some remian illiterate despite this, but on the whole, literacy has become far more widespread. China has also implemented government-sponsored exchange programs which give students a chance to study abroad. In contrast to before, when governments only really concerned themselves with the education of elites, nowadays governments are very involved in the education of ordinary citizens.\n\n\nIn conclustion, education is becoming more and more accessiable due to a number of factors: Computerization has given us new and interesting ways to learn, schooling is no longer restricted to elite, and government has become more involved in educating ther citizens.

One big change is how distance education has made it possible for people to access educational resources and earn advanced degrees from the comfort of their homes. whereas, before people needed to move to big cities or towns to get a good education, now they can take online courses and receive quality instruction even in rural and remote areas. Computerization has brought lots of small changes too. Electronic dictionaries enable us to look up words more efficiently. Education computer programs and smart-phone apps make it possible for us to interect with information in more vivid ways. Watching informative videos online can stimulate interest to outside of classroom.  Additionally, education has become more attainable because it is no longer restricted to upper-classes of society. While in the past only the rich could afford tuition fees for prestigious institutions, today good schools has become a higher priority in today's society, private tutors are also more common and no longer reserved only for high-class families. As long as they have determination, anyone can receive tutoring, attend a university, and gain academic qualifications. Even if they cannot afford to pay tuition, determined students can obtain scholarships or take out students loans.  Finally, in most counties today, governments have a greater involvement in promoting education. In China, for example, education is compulsory from grades 1-9. The government has even created programs to send teacher to less developed areas in order to ensure that everyone receives this minimun level of schooling. Some remian illiterate despite this, but on the whole, literacy has become far more widespread. China has also implemented government-sponsored exchange programs which give students a chance to study abroad. In contrast to before, when governments only really concerned themselves with the education of elites, nowadays governments are very involved in the education of ordinary citizens.  In conclustion, education is becoming more and more accessiable due to a number of factors: Computerization has given us new and interesting ways to learn, schooling is no longer restricted to elite, and government has become more involved in educating ther citizens. Overall, getting education has become easier for everyone in modern times.",

When she first attended boarding school, she called home every day and cried about the difference problems she encountered. Such as the difficulty of having to living with roommates or wash her clothes. Yet, to her parent's surperise, within weeks she had gotten used to her new surroundings.

            "text": "\u8303\u6587\n\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the following statement: Government should spend more money on evironment protection than economic development.\n\n\nA question central to today's environment debate is how economic development and environment protection interlate. Some people maintain that governments should invest more in solving evironmental issues. I agree three reasons listed below.\n\n\nFirstly, it would be for the sake of sutainable development. Obviously, economic targets cannot be met without some degree of environmental sacrifice, but as a result, goverments should strive to compensate for such losses. Take chemical factories for example. In the past, they would release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pour waste directly into rivers in their vicinity, which would contribute to global warmming and lead to the  degradation of local water supplies and the death of aquatic life. Not only that, but they would also threaten the liveihoods of those depending on the land for survival. In the long run, the factories, would have to be shut down because of the damage they caused. This could have been avoided if they used proper waste desposal systems, but they were reluctant to do so because they wanted to cut costs and maximize profits. It is these cases that government should step forward and take a stand. Fox example, governments could provide funding for waste purification systems or eco-friendly equipment in order to reduce waste and minimize pollution. Since customers are keen to buy products made by an environmentally conscious business, green industries are likely to enjoy better economic growth and a longer lifespan. \n\n\nSecondly, in this era of globalization, environmental protection helps to strengthen a country's international status. China has become one of the world's largest polluters. According to China's National Climate Change Program, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China, China's greenhouse gas emissions have grown at least 30% from 1999 to 2009. In addition, deforestation due to logging and land development has lead to the destruction of huge swaths of China's wilderness. The destruction of these habitats has already driven many species to the brink of extinction, including the South China tiger and the giant panda. If the government does nothing about the country's environmental issues, the will receive pressure from the international community and may face reduced trade and cooperation with other countries.\n\n\nLastly, governments should invest in solving environmental problems simply because they are in the best postion to do so. Businesses can find other private sources of funding, whereas the ability to fix pervasive environmental issues necessarily depends on planning, regulation, and funding that is both centralized and massive in scope. Businesses for the most part lack an economic incentive to be environmentally firendly, and even if this weren't the case, a single business could only create positive environmental changes locally. The push will never come from them. The task of saving the environment thus falls to governments, which happen to be the bodies with the most power\u2014\u2014and thus the most responsibility\u2014\u2014 to promote environmentally friendly practices anyway.\n\n\nAll in all, it is strongly advisable for governments to allocate more funds toward environmental preservation rather than economic development.\n\n\nNew

            "text": "Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Government should spend more money on evironment protection than economic development.  A question central to today's environment debate is how economic development and environment protection interlate. Some people maintain that governments should invest more in solving evironmental issues. I agree three reasons listed below.  Firstly, it would be for the sake of sutainable development. Obviously, economic targets cannot be met without some degree of environmental sacrifice, but as a result, goverments should strive to compensate for such losses. Take chemical factories for example. In the past, they would release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pour waste directly into rivers in their vicinity, which would contribute to global warmming and lead to the  degradation of local water supplies and the death of aquatic life. Not only that, but they would also threaten the liveihoods of those depending on the land for survival. In the long run, the factories, would have to be shut down because of the damage they caused. This could have been avoided if they used proper waste desposal systems, but they were reluctant to do so because they wanted to cut costs and maximize profits. It is these cases that government should step forward and take a stand. Fox example, governments could provide funding for waste purification systems or eco-friendly equipment in order to reduce waste and minimize pollution. Since customers are keen to buy products made by an environmentally conscious business, green industries are likely to enjoy better economic growth and a longer lifespan.   Secondly, in this era of globalization, environmental protection helps to strengthen a country's international status. China has become one of the world's largest polluters. According to China's National Climate Change Program, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China, China's greenhouse gas emissions have grown at least 30% from 1999 to 2009. In addition, deforestation due to logging and land development has lead to the destruction of huge swaths of China's wilderness. The destruction of these habitats has already driven many species to the brink of extinction, including the South China tiger and the giant panda. If the government does nothing about the country's environmental issues, the will receive pressure from the international community and may face reduced trade and cooperation with other countries.  Lastly, governments should invest in solving environmental problems simply because they are in the best postion to do so. Businesses can find other private sources of funding, whereas the ability to fix pervasive environmental issues necessarily depends on planning, regulation, and funding that is both centralized and massive in scope. Businesses for the most part lack an economic incentive to be environmentally firendly, and even if this weren't the case, a single business could only create positive environmental changes locally. The push will never come from them. The task of saving the environment thus falls to governments, which happen to be the bodies with the most power\u2014\u2014and thus the most responsibility\u2014\u2014 to promote environmentally friendly practices anyway.  All in all, it is strongly advisable for governments to allocate more funds toward environmental preservation rather than economic development.",

For one thing she believes that students will need hot food from time to time. For example on cold mornings students will need hot food like hot cereal more than cold food like yogurt.

BECAUSE some students have interested, but  fewer and fewer art major's are taking sculpture classes. MOREOVER the only sculpture professor is retiring, they have no money to hire a full-time professor. IN THE CONVERSATION, THE WOMAN DISAGREES WITH THIS. FIRST OF ALL, the low enrolment isn't because art majors don't want to take these classes. The required courses are mostly painting and drawing, and they take up all our time. What we really need are different requirements. Then art majors could take a better variety of classes, all things we're insterested in. WHAT'S MORE, If money is the problem, they could hire a part-time professor. Or most of the professors in the department have secondary fields.

For one thing she believes that students will need hot food from time to time. For example on cold mornings students will need hot food like hot cereal more than cold food like yogurt. Secondly she argues that the students will go off-campus to pay more prices to get what they want due to the cutting back of meals. As a result the cost will actually add up and is therefore a worse situation for the students. All in all, the woman disagrees with the announcement for the reasons stated above.

Because students complains that the daytime classes is increasingly overcrowded and there are no longer enough computers available.\nIn the listening, the man disagrees with this. First of all, students are very busy at night, they have jobs, families, clubs, and social events. They already have something to do every single night of the week. They cound't fit anything into their schedule during the week. Second, It cost money to fire more teachers and keep academic building open later, which is more expensive than buying more computers. And the department rooms are very big, there's a plenty of space to add more computers. Note",

But most students aren't like that, they come to class prepared and rested and they can concentrate. WHAT'S MORE, Tim was in one of her classes last year and whenever she looked at him he was actually sleeping, so he can't know what's happening, what other people in class are doing.
